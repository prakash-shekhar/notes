# The nation's Sick Economy
## Economic Troubles on the Horizon
As the 1920s advanced, serious problems threatened economic prosper-ity. The federal government’s laissez-faire economic policies played a part. During the decade, high tariffs had protected some businesses but hurt international trade and weakened European economies. Taxes on the richest Americans and on businesses had been reduced. As a result, government rev-enues dropped, and federal spending declined. Meanwhile, some businesses thrived, making a few people rich. But Americans with yearly incomes of more than $100,000 made up just 0.1 percent of the population. Many more Americans could not earn a decent living. Industries that had once been cen-tral to the American economy struggled. Farmers grew more crops and raised more livestock than they could sell at a profit. Both consumers and farmers were steadily going deeper into debt. As the decade ended, these slippages in the economy signaled the end of an era.
### INDUSTRIES IN TROUBLE
The superficial prosperity of the late 1920s masked weaknesses that would signal the onset of the Great Depression. Key basic industries, such as railroads, textiles, and steel, had barely made a profit. Railroads lost business to new forms of transportation—trucks, buses, and private automobiles, for instance. As these industries declined, they laid off workers or reduced their hours.Mining and lumbering, which had expanded during wartime, were no lon-ger in high demand. Coal mining was especially hard-hit, in part due to stiff competition from new forms of energy, including hydroelectric power, fuel oil, and natural gas. By the early 1930s these sources supplied more than half the energy that had once come from coal. Overproduction weakened even the boom industries of the 1920s—automobiles, construction, and consumer goods. As easy credit had allowed these businesses to expand, they had manufactured far more products than consumers could afford to buy. One important economic indicator that declined during this time was housing starts—the number of new dwellings being built. Real estate prices were too high for too many people. When housing starts fall, so do jobs in many related industries, such as furniture manufacturing and lumbering. The situation was particularly evident in Florida, where expectations of big profits had driven real estate prices way up, but actual buyers were scarce.
### FARMERS NEED A LIFT
Perhaps agriculture suffered the most. During World War I, prices rose, and international demand for crops such as wheat and corn soared so the troops could be fed. Farmers had planted more and taken out loans for land and equipment. However, demand fell after the war, and crop prices declined by 40 percent or more. Deflation, or a decrease in the general price level of goods and services, took hold.Farmers boosted production in the hopes of selling more crops, but this only dropped prices further. Between 1919 and 1921 annual farm income declined from $10 billion to just over $4 billion. Farmers who had gone into debt had difficulty paying off their loans. Many lost their farms when banks foreclosed and seized the property as payment for the debt. As farmers began to default on their loans, many rural banks began to fail. Auctions were held to recoup some of the banks’ losses. Congress tried to help out farmers with a piece of legislation called the McNary-Haugen bill. This called for federal price supports for key products such as wheat, corn, cotton, and tobacco. The government would buy sur-plus crops at guaranteed prices and sell them on the world market.President Coolidge vetoed the bill twice. He commented, “Farmers have never made money. I don’t believe we can do much about it.” 
### CONSUMERS HAVE LESS MONEY TO SPEND
As farmers’ incomes fell, they bought fewer goods and services, but the problem was larger. By the late 1920s Americans were buying less—mainly because of rising prices, stag-nant wages, unbalanced distribution of income, and overbuying on credit in the preceding years. Production had also expanded much faster than wages, resulting in an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor.
### LIVING ON CREDIT
Although many Americans appeared to be prosperous during the 1920s, they were, in fact, living beyond their means. They often bought goods on credit—an arrangement in which consumers agreed to buy now and pay later for purchases. This was often in the form of an install-ment plan (usually in monthly payments) that included interest charges.By making credit easily available, businesses encouraged Americans to pile up a large consumer debt. Many people then had trouble paying off what they owed on their purchases. Faced with debt, consumers cut back on spending.
### UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME
During the 1920s the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. Between 1920 and 1929, the income of the wealthi-est 1 percent of the population rose by 75 percent, compared with a 9 per-cent increase for Americans as a whole. More than 70 percent of the nation’s families earned less than $2,500 per year, then considered the minimum amount needed for a decent standard of living. Even families earning twice that much could not afford many of the household items that manufacturers produced. Economists estimate that the average man or woman bought a new outfit of clothes only once a year. Scarcely half the homes in many cities had electric lights or a furnace for heat. Only one city home in ten had an electric refrigerator.This unequal distribution of income meant that most Americans could not participate fully in the economic advances of the 1920s. Many people did not have the money to purchase the flood of goods that factories pro-duced. The prosperity of the era rested on a fragile foundation.
## Hoover Takes the Nation
Although economic disaster was around the corner, the election of 1928 took place in a mood of apparent national prosperity. This election pitted Republican candidate Herbert Hoover against Democrat Alfred E. Smith.
### THE ELECTION OF 1928
Hoover, the secretary of commerce under Hard-ing and Coolidge, was a mining engineer from Iowa who had never run for public office. Smith was a career politician who had served four terms as governor of New York. He was personable and enjoyed being in the lime-light, unlike the quiet and reserved Hoover. Still, Hoover had one major advantage: he could point to years of prosperity under Republicans since 1920. In a famous campaign address, often called the “rugged individual-ism” speech, Hoover praised the postwar American spirit, comparing it to European systems. For Hoover, the American system of government was the opposite of the governments in Europe. He believed that a focus on individual achieve-ment—instead of a central government that controlled most aspects of the economy—made the United States great. According to Hoover, to shift away from this focus would destroy the nation. This confidence in the American spirit helped many believe him when he declared, “We in  America are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before.” It was an overwhelming victory for Hoover. The message was clear: most Americans were happy with Republican leadership.
### DREAMS OF RICHES IN THE STOCK MARKET
By 1929 some economists had warned of weaknesses in the economy, but most Americans maintained the utmost confidence in the nation’s economic health. In increaing numbers, those who could afford to invested in the stock market. The stock market had become the most visible symbol of a prosperous American economy. Then, as now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the most widely used barometer of the stock market’s health. The Dow is a measure based on the stock prices of 30 representative large firms trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Through most of the 1920s, stock prices rose steadily. The Dow had reached a high of 381 points, nearly 300 points higher than it had been five years earlier. Eager to take advantage of this “bull market”—a period of rising stock prices—Americans rushed to buy stocks and bonds. One observer wrote, “It seemed as if all economic law had been suspended and a new era opened up in which success and prosperity could be had without knowledge or industry.” By 1929 about 4 million Americans—or 3 percent of the nation’s population—owned stocks. Many of these investors were already wealthy, but others were average Americans who hoped to strike it rich. However, the seeds of trouble were taking root. People were engaging in speculation—that is, they bought stocks and bonds on the chance of a quick profit, while ignoring the risks. Many began buying on margin—paying a small percentage of a stock’s price as a down payment and bor-rowing the rest. With easy money available to investors, the unrestrained buying and selling fueled the market’s upward spiral. The government did little to discourage such buying or to regulate the market. In reality, these rising prices did not reflect companies’ worth. Worse, if the value of stocks declined, people who had bought on margin had no way to pay off the loans. The trend of buying on margin troubled the governing board of the Fed-eral Reserve System, known as the Fed. The Fed had been created in 1913 to serve as the nation’s central bank, a role it continues to fill. The Fed sets monetary policy to promote economic growth. In the late 1920s the Fed decided to make it harder for brokers to offer margin loans to inves-tors. Their strategy was partly successful, at least at first. Borrowing from banks decreased, but large corporations began providing brokers with the cash to make margin loans. As a result, the run-up of the stock market continued despite the Fed’s shift in monetary policy.
## The Stock Market Crashes
In early September 1929 stock prices peaked and then fell. Confidence in the market started to waver, and some investors quickly sold their stocks and pulled out. On October 24 the market took a plunge. Panicked inves-tors unloaded their shares. But the worst was yet to come.On October 29—now known as Black Tuesday—the bottom fell out of the market and the nation’s confidence. Shareholders frantically tried to sell before prices dropped even lower. The number of shares dumped onto the market that day was a record 16.4 million. Additional millions of shares could not find buyers. People who had bought stocks on credit were stuck with huge debts as the prices plummeted, while others lost most of their savings. By mid-November, investors had lost about $30 billion, an amount equal to how much America spent in World War I. The stock market bubble had finally burst. One eyewitness to these shocking events described the resulting situation.
## Financial Collapse
The stock market crash signaled the beginning of the Great Depression—the period from 1929 through the 1930s in which the economy plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed. The crash alone did not cause the Great Depression, but it hastened the collapse of the economy and made the Depression more severe.
### BANK AND BUSINESS FAILURES 
After the crash, many people panicked and withdrew their money from banks. But some couldn’t get their money because the banks had no money, either. They had invested the cash in the stock market. In 1929, 600 banks closed. By 1933, 11,000 of the nation’s 25,000 banks had failed. Because the government did not protect or insure bank accounts, millions of people lost their savings. The Federal Reserve System might have supplied more money to banks, but rules linking cur-rency to gold reserves hampered those efforts. On the other hand, some Fed officials saw bank failures in a positive light—as a good way to get rid of bad managers. The Great Depression hit other businesses along with banks. Between 1929 and 1932, the gross national product—the nation’s total output of goods and services—was cut nearly in half, from $104 billion to $59 bil-lion. Approximately 90,000 businesses went bankrupt. Among these failed enterprises were once-prosperous automobile and railroad companies. The stock market crash affected business in another way, too. Prior to the crash, businesses had attracted a large amount of capital for invest-ment in new machinery, new markets, and other ventures. With the crash, Americans lost confidence in business, and business, in turn, lost confi-dence in consumers. Businesses sharply reduced their investments, which cascaded into reducing their work forces. SpendingAs the economy plunged into a tailspin, millions of workers lost their jobs. Unemployment jumped from 3 percent (1.6 million workers) in 1929 to 25 percent (13  million workers) in 1933. One out of every four workers was out of a job. Those who kept their jobs faced pay cuts and reduced hours.Not everyone fared so badly, of course. Before the crash, some speculators had sold off their stocks and made money. Joseph P. Kennedy, the father of future president John F. Kennedy, was one who did. Most, however, were not so lucky or shrewd.
### WORLDWIDE SHOCK WAVES
Due to a growth in international trade, many of the world’s nations had become interdependent. However, when the U.S. economy failed, American investors withdrew their money from European markets. As a result, the United States was not the only country gripped by the Great Depression. Much of Europe, for example, had suffered through-out the 1920s. European countries trying to recover from the ravages of World War I faced high war debts, so their economies were already unstable. In addition, Germany had to pay war reparations—payments to compensate the Allies for the damages Germany had caused. The Great Depression com-pounded these problems by limiting America’s ability to import European goods. This made it difficult to sell American farm products and manufac-tured goods abroad. Eventually, countries all around the world were affected by the financial collapse as unemployment rates soared and prices  plummeted. In Europe, Austria’s largest bank failed. In Asia, both farmers and urban workers suffered as the value of exports fell by half between 1929 and 1931. In Latin America, a decrease in U.S. and European demand for their prod-ucts—such as sugar, beef, and copper—caused prices to fall.In 1930 Congress passed the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act, which estab-lished the highest protective tariff in U.S. history. It was designed to pro-tect American farmers and manufacturers from foreign competition. Yet it had the opposite effect. By reducing the flow of goods into the United States, the tariff prevented other countries from earning American cur-rency to buy American goods. The tariff made unemployment worse in industries that could no longer export goods to Europe. Many countries retaliated by raising their own tariffs. Within a few years, world trade had fallen more than 40 percent.
### CAUSES OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION
Although historians and econo-mists emphasize different causes of the Great Depression, most cite a com-mon set of factors, among them:
- tariffs and war debt policies that reduced the foreign market for  American goods
- a crisis in the farm sector
- the availability of easy credit
- an unequal distribution of income

These factors led to falling demand for consumer goods, even as newly mechanized factories produced more products. The federal government  contributed to the crisis by keeping interest rates low, thereby allowing companies and individuals to borrow easily and build up large debts. Some of this borrowed money was used to buy the stocks that later led to the crash.At first people found it hard to believe that economic disaster had struck. In November 1929 President Hoover encouraged Americans to remain confident about the economy. Yet, the most severe depression in American history was well on its way.
# Hardship and Suffering
## The Depression Devastates People's Lives
Statistics such as the unemployment rate tell only part of the story of the Great Depression. More important was the impact that it had on people’s lives: the Depression brought hardship, homelessness, and hunger  to millions.
### THE DEPRESSION IN THE CITIES
In cities across the country, people lost their jobs, were evicted from their homes, and ended up in the streets. Some slept in parks or sewer pipes, wrapping themselves in newspapers to fend off the cold.Others built makeshift shacks out of scrap materials. Before long, numerous shantytowns—little towns consisting of shacks—sprang up. An observer recalled one such settlement in Oklahoma City: “Here were all these people living in old, rusted-out car bodies. . . . There were people living in shacks made of orange crates. One family with a whole lot of kids were living in a piano box. . . . People were living in whatever they could junk together.” Hundreds of such settlements dotted the country. They were the only shelter available to hundreds of thousands of people who had lost their homes. Many Americans called these shantytowns “Hoover-villes,” since they blamed President Hoover for the Depression.Every day, the poor dug through garbage cans or begged. Soup kitchensoffering free or low-cost food and bread lines, or lines of people waiting to receive food provided by charitable organizations or public agencies, became a common sight. Herman Shumlin, a Broadway theatrical pro-ducer, described the men he saw around him in New York City. Conditions for African Americans and Latinos were especially difficult. Their unemployment rates were higher, and they were the lowest paid. They also dealt with increasing racial violence from unemployed whites. Twenty-four African Americans were lynched in 1933. Latinos—mainly Mexicans and Mexican Ameri-cans living in the Southwest—were also targets. Whites demanded that Latinos be deported, or expelled from the country, even though many had been born in America. By the late 1930s hundreds of thousands of people of Mexican descent relocated to Mexico. Some of them left voluntarily; others the federal government deported. 
### THE DEPRESSION IN RURAL AREAS
Life in rural areas was hard, but it did have one advantage over city life: most farmers could grow food for their families. With falling prices and rising debt, though, thousands of farmers lost their land. Between 1929 and 1932, about 400,000 farms were lost through foreclosure—the process by which a mortgage holder takes back property if an occupant has not made payments. Many farmers turned to tenant farming and barely scraped out a living. 
### THE DUST BOWL
Drought that began in the early 1930s wreaked havoc on the Great Plains. It was a disaster that developed gradually. Several years of good rain and mild winters had lulled farmers into thinking the land was suitable for intensive agriculture. They were soon proved wrong. During the 1920s farmers from Texas to North Dakota had used newly afford-able tractors to break up the grasslands and plant millions of acres of new farmland. Deep plowing had removed the thick protective layer of prairie grasses. Farmers had then exhausted the land through overproduction of crops, and the grasslands became unsuitable for farming. When the rains stopped and winds began to blow in the early 1930s, little grass and few trees were left to hold down the soil. Wind scattered the topsoil, expos-ing sand and grit underneath. The dust traveled hundreds of miles. One windstorm in 1934 picked up millions of tons of dust from the plains and carried it to East Coast cities. The region that was the hardest hit, including parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado, came to be known as the Dust Bowl.Plagued by dust storms and evictions, farmers had to decide whether to con-tinue cultivating unproductive land or give up and move on. Thousands of farmers and sharecroppers decided to leave their land behind. They packed up their families and few belongings and headed west, following Route 66 to California, where they thought they would find jobs. Some of these migrants—known as Okies (a term that originally referred to Oklahomans but came to be used negatively for all migrants)—found work as farmhands. But others continued to wander in search of work. By the end of the 1930s, hundreds of thousands of farm families had migrated to California and other Pacific coast states.
## Effects on the American Family
In the face of the suffering the Great Depression caused, the family stood as a source of strength for most Americans. Although some people feared that hard times would undermine moral values, those concerns were largely unfounded. In general, Americans believed in traditional values and empha-sized the importance of family unity. At a time when money was tight, many 16families entertained themselves by staying at home and playing board games, such as Monopoly®, which was invented in 1933, and listening to the radio. Nevertheless, the economic difficulties of the Great Depression put severe pressure on family life. Making ends meet was a daily struggle, and, in some cases, families broke apart under the strain.
### MEN IN THE STREETS 
Failed industries meant unemployment for countless men. Many of them had difficulty coping with unemployment because they were accustomed to working and supporting their families. Every day, they would set out to walk the streets in search of jobs. As Frederick Lewis Allen noted in Since Yesterday, “Men who have been sturdy and self-respecting work-ers can take unemployment without flinching for a few weeks, a few months, even if they have to see their families suffer; but it is different after a year . . . two years . . . three years.” Some men became so discouraged that they simply stopped trying. Some even abandoned their families. Having left their families behind, some men hit the road. As many as 300,000 transients—or “hoboes” as they were called—wandered the country, hitching rides on railroad boxcars and sleeping under bridges. Over time these hoboes developed a hidden language to help them survive. They would mark houses or fences near railroad yards with symbols that revealed where they could get food, water, or a place to sleep. Some hoboes would occasionally turn up at homeless shelters in big cities. During the early years of the Great Depression, there was no federal system of direct relief—cash payments or food the government provides to the poor. Some cities and charity services did offer help to those who needed it, but the benefits were meager. In New York City, for example, the weekly payment was just $2.39 per family. This was the most generous relief any city offered, but it was still well below the amount needed to feed a family.
### WOMEN STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE 
Women worked hard to help their families survive adversity during the Great Depression. Many canned food and sewed clothes. They also carefully managed household budgets. Jeane Westin, the author of Making Do: How Women Survived the '30s, recalled, “Those days you did everything to save a penny. . . . My next door neighbor and I used to shop together. You could get two pounds of hamburger for a quarter, so we’d buy two pounds and split it—then one week she’d pay the extra penny and the next week I’d pay.”Many women also worked outside the home, though they usually received less money than men did. As the Depres-sion wore on, however, working women became the targets of enormous resent-ment. Many people believed that women, especially married women, had no right to work when there were men who were unemployed. In the early 1930s some cities refused to hire married women as schoolteachers. Many Americans assumed that women were having an easier time than men during the Great Depression because few were seen begging or standing in bread lines. As a matter of fact, many women were starving to death in cold attics and rooming houses. As one writer pointed out, women were often too ashamed to reveal their hardship.
### CHILDREN SUFFER HARDSHIPS 
Children also suffered during the 1930s. Poor diets and a lack of money for health care led to serious health prob-lems. Milk consumption declined across the country, and clinics and hos-pitals reported a dramatic rise in malnutrition and diet-related diseases, such as rickets. At the same time, child-welfare programs were slashed as cities and states cut their budgets in the face of dwindling resources. Falling tax revenues also caused school boards to shorten the school year and even close schools. By 1933 some 2,600 schools across the nation had shut down, leaving more than 300,000 students out of school. Thou-sands of children went to work instead; they often labored in crowded sweatshops under horrendous conditions. Many teenagers looked for a way out of the suffering or to ease the pres-sure on their families. Eugene Williams, age 13, was one of the desperate teens. He said “If I leave my mother, it will mean one less mouth to feed.” Eugene may have been one of the hundreds of thousands of teenage boys, and some girls, who hopped aboard America’s freight trains to zigzag the country in search of work, adventure, and an escape from poverty. These “wild boys” came from every section of the United States, from every corner of society. They were the sons of poor farmers, out-of-work miners, and wealthy parents who had lost everything. “Hoover tourists,” as they were called, were eager to tour America for free. From the age of 11 until 17, George Phillips rode the rails, first catch-ing local freights out of his hometown of Princeton, Missouri. “There is no feeling in the world like sitting in a side-door Pullman and watching the world go by, listening to the clickety-clack of the wheels, hearing that old steam whistle blowing for crossings and towns.” While exciting, the road could also be deadly. Many riders were beaten or jailed by “bulls”—armed freight yard patrolmen. Often riders had to sleep standing up in a constant deafening rumble. Some were accidentally locked in ice cars for days on end. Others fell prey to murderous criminals. From 1929 to 1939, 24,647 trespassers were killed and 27,171 injured on railroad property.
### SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS
The hardships of the Great Depression had a tremendous social and psychological impact. Some people were so demoralized by hard times that they lost their will to survive. Between 1928 and 1932, the suicide rate rose more than 30 percent. Three times as many people were admitted to state mental hospitals as in normal times.The economic problems forced many Americans to accept compromises and make sacrifices that affected them for the rest of their lives. Adults stopped going to the doctor or dentist because they couldn’t afford it. Young people gave up their dreams of going to college. Others put off get-ting married, raising large families, or having children at all. For many people, the stigma of poverty and of having to scrimp and save never disappeared completely. For some, achieving financial security became the primary focus in life. As one woman recalled, “Ever since I was twelve years old there was one major goal in my life . . . one thing . . . and that was to never be poor again.” During the Great Depression, many people showed great kindness to strangers who were down on their luck. People often gave food, clothing, and a place to stay to the needy. Families helped other families and shared resources and strengthened the bonds within their communities. In addi-tion, many people developed habits of saving and thriftiness—habits they would need to see themselves through the dark days ahead as the nation and President Hoover struggled with the Great Depression. These habits shaped a whole generation of Americans.
# Hoover's Failed Policies
## Hoover Tries to Reassure the Nation
After the stock market crash of October 1929, President Herbert Hoovertried to reassure Americans that the nation’s economy was on a sound footing. “Any lack of confidence in the economic future . . . is foolish,” he declared. In his view, the important thing was for Americans to remain optimistic and to go about their business as usual. Most Americans believed depressions were a normal part of the business cycle. According to this theory, periods of rapid economic growth were naturally followed by periods of depression. The best course in a slump, many experts believed, was to do nothing and let the economy fix itself. Hoover took a slightly different position. He felt that government could play a limited role in helping to solve problems.
### HOOVER’S PHILOSOPHY
Herbert Hoover had been an engineer, and he put great faith in the power of reason. He was also a humanitarian, as he made clear in one of his last speeches as president. Like many Americans of the time, Hoover believed that one of government’s chief functions was to foster cooperation between competing groups and interests in society. If business and labor were in a conflict, for example, government should step in and help them find a solution that served their mutual interests. This cooperation must be voluntary rather than forced, he said. Hoover felt government’s role was to encourage and facilitate cooperation, not to control it.On the other hand, Americans also valued the “rugged individualism” that Hoover had praised during his campaign in 1928—the idea that people should succeed through their own efforts. They should take care of themselves and their families, rather than depend on the government to bail them out. Thus, Hoover opposed any form of federal welfare, or direct relief to the needy. He believed that handouts would weaken people’s self-respect and “moral fiber.” His answer to the needy was that individuals, charities, and local organizations should pitch in to help care for the less fortunate. The federal government should direct relief measures, but not through a vast federal bureaucracy. Such a bureaucracy, he said, would be too expensive and would stifle individual liberties. However, when the Great Depression took hold, moral fiber wasn’t what people were worried about. Hoover’s response shocked and frustrated suffering Americans.
### HOOVER TAKES CAUTIOUS STEPS
Hoover’s political philosophy caused him to take a cautious approach to the Depression. Soon after the stock market crash, he called together key business, banking, and labor leaders. He urged them to work together to find solutions to the nation’s economic woes and to act in ways that would not make a bad situation worse. For example, he asked employers not to cut wages or lay off workers, and he asked labor leaders not to demand higher wages or go on strike. He also created a special organization to help private charities generate contribu-tions for the poor.None of these steps made much of a difference. A year after the crash, the economy was still shrinking, and unemployment was still rising. More companies went out of business, soup kitchens became a common sight, and general misery continued to grow. Shantytowns arose in every city, and hoboes continued to roam. 
### BOULDER DAM
One project that Hoover approved did make a difference. Years earlier, when Hoover served as secretary of commerce, one of his earliest proposed initiatives was the construction of a dam on the  Colorado River. Aiming to minimize federal intervention, Hoover proposed to finance the dam’s construction by using profits from sales of the electric power that the dam would generate. He also helped to arrange an agree-ment on water rights among the seven states of the Colorado River basin—Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.By the time the massive project won congressional approval in 1928, as part of a $700 million public works program, Hoover had been elected to the White House. In the fall of 1929, nearly one year into his presidency, Hoover was finally able to authorize construction of Boulder Dam (later called Hoover Dam). At 726 feet high and 1,244 feet long, it would be the world’s tallest dam and the second largest. In addition to providing elec-tricity and flood control, the dam also provided a regular water supply, which enabled the growth of California’s massive agricultural economy. Today, the dam also helps to provide water for cities such as Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
### DEMOCRATS WIN IN 1930 CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS 
As the country’s economic difficulties increased, the political tide turned against Hoover and the Republicans. In the 1930 congressional elections, the Democrats took advantage of anti-Hoover sentiments to win more seats in Congress. As a result of that election, the Republicans lost control of the House of Represen-tatives and saw their majority in the Senate dwindle to one.As Americans grew more and more frustrated by the Depression, they expressed their anger in a number of ways. Farmers stung by low crop prices burned their corn and wheat and dumped their milk on highways rather than sell it at a loss. Some farmers even declared a “farm holiday” and refused to work their fields. A number blocked roads to prevent food from getting to market, hoping that food shortages would raise prices. Some farmers also used force to prevent authorities from foreclosing on farms. Americans expressed their dissatisfaction with Hoover and his policies by attaching his name to various symbols of the Depression. In addition to refer-ring to shantytowns as “Hoovervilles,” homeless people called the newspapers they wrapped themselves in “Hoover blankets.” Empty pockets turned inside out were “Hoover flags.” Many Americans who had hailed Hoover as a great humanitarian a few years earlier now saw him as a cold and heartless man. Despite public criticism, Hoover continued to hold firm to his principles. He refused to support direct relief or other forms of federal welfare. Many Ameri-cans were going hungry, and they blamed Hoover for their plight. Criticism of the president and his policies continued to grow. An anonymous ditty that skewered Hoover, Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, and powerful busi-ness interests was widely repeated.
## Hoover Takes Action
As time went on and the Depression deepened, President Hoover gradu-ally softened his position on government intervention in the economy and took a more activist approach to the nation’s economic troubles.
### HOOVER BACKS COOPERATIVES
In Hoover’s view, Boulder Dam was a model of how the federal government could encourage cooperation. His attempts to relieve the Depression involved negotiating agreements among private entities, again reflecting his belief in small government. For exam-ple, he backed the creation of the Federal Farm Board, an organization of farm cooperatives. The farm board was intended to raise crop prices by helping members buy crops and keep them off the market until prices rose.In addition, Hoover tried to prop up the banking system by persuad-ing the nation’s largest banks to establish the National Credit Corpora-tion. This organization loaned money to smaller banks to help them avoid bankruptcy.
### DIRECT INTERVENTION
By late 1931, however, many people could see that these measures had failed to turn the economy around. With a presi-dential election looming, Hoover appealed to Congress to pass a series of measures to reform banking, provide mortgage relief, and funnel more federal money into business investment. In 1932 Hoover signed into law the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, which lowered mortgage rates for homeowners and allowed farmers to refinance their farm loans and avoid foreclosure. It was not until Hoover’s time in office was over that Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Banking Act, which separated investment from commercial banking and would, Congress hoped, prevent another crash.The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) was Hoover’s most ambitious economic measure, however, and was approved by Congress in January 1932. It authorized up to $2 billion for emergency financing for banks, life insurance companies, railroads, and other large businesses. Hoover believed that the money would trickle down to the average citi-zen through job growth and higher wages. Many critics questioned this approach; they argued that the program would benefit only corporations and that the poor still needed direct relief. Hungry people could not wait for the benefits to trickle down to their tables. In its first five months of operation, the RFC loaned more than $805 mil-lion to large corporations, but business failures continued. The RFC was an unprecedented example of federal involvement in a peacetime economy, but in the end it was too little, too late.
## The Bonus Army
In 1932 an incident further damaged Hoover’s image and public morale. That spring, between 10,000 and 20,000 World War I veterans and their families arrived in Washington, DC, from various parts of the country. They called themselves the Bonus Expeditionary Force, or the Bonus Army.
### THE PATMAN BILL DENIED
Led by Walter Waters, an unemployed cannery worker from Oregon, the Bonus Army came to the nation’s capital to support a bill under debate in Congress. The Patman Bill authorized the government to pay a bonus to World War I veterans who had not been compensated ade-quately for their wartime service. This bonus, which Congress had approved in 1924, was supposed to be paid out in 1945 in the form of cash and a life insurance policy. Congressman Wright Patman believed that the money—an average of $500 per soldier—should be paid immediately.Hoover thought that the Bonus Marchers were “communists and persons with criminal records” rather than veterans. He opposed the legislation, but he respected the marchers’ right to peaceful assembly. He even provided food and supplies so that they could erect a shantytown within sight of the Capi-tol. On June 17, however, the Senate voted down the Patman Bill. Hoover then called on the Bonus Army marchers to leave. Most did, but approxi-mately 2,000, still hoping to meet with the president, refused to budge.
### HOOVER DISBANDS THE BONUS ARMY
Nervous that the angry group could become violent, Presi-dent Hoover decided that the Bonus Army should be disbanded. On July 28 a force of 1,000 soldiers under the command of General Douglas MacAr-thur and his aide, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower, came to roust the veterans. A government official watching from a nearby office recalled what hap-pened next. In the course of the operation, the infantry gassed more than 1,000 people, including an 11-month-old baby, who died, and an 8-year-old boy, who was partially blinded. Two people were shot and many were injured. Most Ameri-cans were stunned and outraged when they heard about the treatment of the veterans.Once again, President Hoover’s image suffered, and now an election was nearing. In November, Hoover would face a formidable opponent, the Demo-cratic candidate and popular New York governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When Roosevelt heard about the attack on the Bonus Army, he said to his friend Felix Frankfurter, “Well, Felix, this will elect me.” The downturn in the economy and Hoover’s inability to deal effectively with the Depression had sealed his political fate.
# A New Deal Fights The Depression
## Americans Get a New Deal
The 1932 presidential election showed that Americans were clearly ready for a change. The Depression had robbed people of work, food, and hope.
### ELECTING FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT
The Republicans renomi-nated President Hoover. But they recognized he had little chance of win-ning. Too many Americans blamed Hoover for doing too little about the Depression. They wanted a new president. The Democrats pinned their hopes on Franklin Delano Roosevelt, known popularly as FDR. He was the two-term governor of New York and a distant cousin of former president Theodore Roosevelt.As governor, FDR had proved an effective, reform-minded leader, work-ing to combat unemployment and poverty. Unlike Hoover, Roosevelt possessed a “can-do” attitude and projected an air of friendliness and con-fidence. This attitude attracted voters.Indeed, Roosevelt won an overwhelming victory.  He captured nearly 23 million votes to Hoover’s nearly 16 million. In the Senate, Democrats claimed a nearly two-thirds majority. In the House, they won almost three-fourths of the seats. It was their greatest victory since before the Civil War. 
### WAITING FOR ROOSEVELT TO TAKE OVER
Four months would elapse between Roosevelt’s victory in the November election and his inaugura-tion as president in March 1933. The Twentieth Amendment, which moved presidential inaugurations to January, was not ratified until February 1933. It therefore  did not apply to the 1932 election.FDR was not idle during this waiting period, however. He worked with  his team of carefully picked advisers—a select group of professors, law-yers, and journalists that came to be known as the “Brain Trust.” Roosevelt began to formulate a set of policies for his new administration. This pro-gram, designed to alleviate the problems of the Great Depression, became known as the New Deal. The term originated in a campaign speech when Roosevelt had promised “a new deal for the American people.” New Deal policies focused on three general goals: relief for the needy, economic recovery, and financial reform. 
### THE HUNDRED DAYS
Roosevelt knew that for the New Deal to be able to improve the U.S. economy, he first needed to reestablish Americans’ con-fidence. His inauguration speech in 1933 was one of his first steps to do so. He reminded Americans that their fears for their economic future were unfounded and concerned “only material things.” Immediately upon taking office, the Roosevelt administration launched a period of intense activity known as the Hundred Days, lasting from March 9 to June 16, 1933. During this period, Congress passed more than 15 major pieces of New Deal legislation. These laws, and others that followed, signifi-cantly expanded the federal government’s role in the nation’s economy and in citizens’ lives. They also changed the relationship between the federal and state governments.Roosevelt’s first step as president was to reform banking and finance. By 1933 widespread bank failures had caused most Americans to lose faith in the banking system. On March 5, one day after taking office, Roosevelt declared a bank holiday and closed all banks to prevent further withdraw-als. He persuaded Congress to pass the Emergency Banking Relief Act, which authorized the Treasury Department to inspect the country’s banks. Those that were sound could reopen at once. Those that were insolvent—unable to pay their debts—would remain closed. Those that needed help could receive loans. This measure revived public confidence in banks, since customers now had greater faith that the open banks were in good financial shape.
### AN IMPORTANT FIRESIDE CHAT
On March 12, the day before the first banks were to reopen, President Roosevelt gave the first of his many fireside chats—radio talks about issues of public concern, explaining in clear, simple language his New Deal measures. These informal talks made Americans feel as if the president were talking directly to them. In his first chat, Roosevelt took time to calm Americans’ fears about the bank crisis. He acknowledged that closing the banks had caused stress and hardship. But he reassured his listeners that the banks would reopen and the American financial system would return as strong as ever. As Roosevelt explained, the banking crisis was caused in large part by panic. When too many people demanded their savings in cash, banks would fail. This was not because banks were weak but because even strong banks could not meet such heavy demands. Over the next few weeks, many Americans returned their savings to banks.
### REGULATING BANKING AND FINANCE 
Congress took another step to reorganize the banking system by passing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. This act established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC provided federal insurance for individual bank accounts of up to $5,000, reassuring millions of bank customers that their money was safe. It also required banks to act cautiously with their customers’ money.Congress and the president also worked to regulate the stock market, in which people had lost faith because of the crash of 1929. The Federal Securities  Act, passed in May 1933, required corporations to provide complete information on all stock offerings and made them liable for any misrepresentations. In June 1934 Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market. One goal of this commission was to  prevent people with inside information about compa-nies from “rigging” the stock  market for their own profit.In addition, Roosevelt persuaded Congress to approve a bill allowing the manufacture and sale of some alcoholic beverages. The bill’s main purpose was to raise government revenues by taxing alcohol. By the end of 1933, the Twenty-First Amendment had repealed prohibition altogether.
## Helping the American People
While working on banking and financial matters, the Roosevelt adminis-tration also focused on other ways to stimulate economic recovery and to  aid Americans.
### RURAL ASSISTANCE
Having suffered the double blow of the drought in the Dust Bowl and the national economic crisis, farmers were perhaps the hardest hit by the Depression. The government soon implemented several rural assistance programs to aid them. The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) sought to raise crop prices by lowering production. The government achieved this goal by paying farmers to leave a certain amount of every acre of land unseeded. The theory was that reduced supply would boost prices. In some cases, crops were too far advanced for the acreage reduc-tion to take effect. As a result, the government paid cotton growers $200 million to plow under 10 million acres of their crop. It also paid hog farm-ers to slaughter 6 million pigs. These subsidies upset many Americans, who protested the destruction of food when many people were going hun-gry. It did, however, help raise farm prices and put more money in farmers’ pockets.Several New Deal programs focused specifically on the impoverished Tennessee River Valley. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), established on May 18, 1933, was particularly ambitious. The TVA renovated five existing dams and constructed 20 new ones, created thousands of jobs, and provided flood control, hydroelectric power, and other benefits to the region. The government also established the Cumberland Homesteads in eastern Tennessee. There, hundreds of poor families were resettled on small farms and worked in community-owned businesses. The community never attracted enough good-paying jobs, however, and the ven-ture ultimately failed. 
### PROVIDING WORK PROJECTS
The administra-tion also established programs to provide relief through work projects and cash payments. One important program, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), put young men aged 18 to 25 to work. CCC members built roads, developed  parks, planted trees, and helped in soil-erosion and flood-control projects. By the time the program ended in 1942, almost 3 million young men had passed through the CCC. The CCC paid a small wage, $30 a month, of which $25 was automatically sent home to the worker’s fam-ily. It also supplied free food and uniforms and lodging in work camps. Many of the camps were located on the Great Plains, where, within a period of eight years, the men of the CCC planted more than 200 million trees. This tremendous reforestation program was aimed at preventing another Dust Bowl. Another major CCC project took place in Florida, where CCC workers built the 100-mile Overseas Highway to link Miami and Key West. The new highway was needed to replace the railroad—destroyed in a 1935 hurri-cane—that once linked these tourist destinations.The Public Works Administration (PWA)  was created in June 1933 as part of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). The PWA provided money to states to create jobs chiefly in the construction of schools and other community buildings. When these programs failed to make a suf-ficient dent in unemployment, President Roosevelt established the Civil Works Administration (CWA) in November 1933. It provided 4 million immediate jobs during the winter of 1933–1934. Some critics of the CWA claimed that the programs were “make-work” projects and a waste of money. However, the CWA built 40,000 schools and paid the salaries of more than 50,000 schoolteachers in America’s rural areas. It also built more than half a million miles of roads. 
### PROMOTING FAIR PRACTICES
The NIRA also sought to promote indus-trial growth by establishing codes of fair practice for individual industries. It created the National Recovery Administration (NRA), which set prices of many products and established standards. The aim of the NRA was to promote recovery by interrupting the trend of wage cuts, falling prices, and layoffs. Economist Gardiner C. Means attempted to justify the NRA by stating the goal of industrial planning. The codes of fair practice had been drafted in joint meetings of businesses and representatives of workers and consumers. These codes limited produc-tion and established prices. Because businesses were given new concessions, workers made demands. Congress met their demands by passing a section of the NIRA guaranteeing workers’ right to unionize and to bargain collectively. Many businesses and politicians criticized the NRA. Some charged that the codes served large business interests. There were also charges of increas-ing code violations. 
### FOOD, CLOTHING, AND SHELTER
A number of New Deal programs con-cerned housing and home mortgage problems. The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) provided government loans to homeowners who faced foreclosure because they couldn’t make their loan payments. In addition, the 1934 National Housing Act created the Federal Housing Administra-tion (FHA). This agency continues to furnish loans for home mortgages and repairs today.Another program, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), was funded with $500 million to provide direct relief for the needy. Half of the money was given to the states as direct grants-in-aid to help furnish food and clothing to the unemployed, the aged, and the ill. The rest was dis-tributed to states to support work relief programs. For every $3 within the state program, FERA donated $1. Harry Hopkins, who headed this program, believed that, whereas money helped people buy food, it was meaningful work that enabled them to gain confidence and self-respect.
## The New Deal Comes Under Attack
By the end of the Hundred Days, millions of Americans had benefited from the New Deal programs. The public’s confidence in the nation’s future had rebounded as well. The government’s policy of deficit spending—spending more money than it receives in revenue—was stimulating economic recov-ery, despite putting the government deeply into debt. With more of their own money in their hands, consumers could buy goods and services and thus fuel economic growth. Although President Roosevelt agreed to deficit spending, he did so reluc-tantly. He regarded it as a necessary evil to be used only at a time of great economic crisis. Nevertheless, the New Deal did not end the Depression, and opposition grew among some parts of the population. Liberal critics worried that the New Deal would not go far enough to help the poor and to reform the nation’s economic system. Conservative critics argued that Roosevelt’s direct relief plan would cost the government too much. They also believed that he would use New Deal policies to control business and socialize the economy. Conservatives were particularly angered by laws such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which they believed gave the federal government too much control over agriculture and industry. Many critics believed the New Deal would interfere with the workings of a free-market economy.
### THE SUPREME COURT REACTS
By the mid-1930s conservative opposition to the New Deal had received a boost from two Supreme Court decisions. In 1935 the Court ruled the NIRA unconstitutional. It declared that the law upset the established system of checks and balances by giving legislative powers to the execu-tive branch. Additionally, the Court said that the enforcement of industry codes within states went beyond the federal government’s constitutional pow-ers to regulate interstate commerce. The next year, the Supreme Court struck down the AAA on the grounds that agriculture is a local matter and should be regulated by the states rather than by the federal government.  President Roosevelt feared that further Court deci-sions might dismantle the New Deal. To prevent such a Court action, in February 1937 he asked Congress to enact a court reform bill. If passed, the bill would reor-ganize the federal judiciary and allow FDR to appoint six new Supreme Court justices. Most observers saw this bill as a clumsy effort to “pack” the Supreme Court with friendly justices. They also viewed it as a dangerous attempt to upset the constitutional balance of power. Some of the Supreme Court’s rulings had been based on the belief that the executive branch had usurped too much legislative power. The court reform bill would further shift the relation-ship between the branches by allowing the executive to use legislation to interfere with judicial independence. As it turned out, the president got his way without reorganizing the judiciary. In 1937 an elderly justice retired, and Roosevelt appointed the liberal Hugo S. Black, shifting the balance of the Court. Rulings of the Court began to favor the New Deal. Over the next four years, because of further resignations, Roosevelt was able to appoint seven new justices.
### THREE FIERY CRITICS
In 1934 some of the strongest conservative oppo-nents of the New Deal banded together to form an organization called the American Liberty League. The American Liberty League opposed New Deal measures that it believed violated respect for the rights of individuals and property. Three of the toughest critics the president faced, however, were three men who expressed views that appealed to poor Americans: Charles Coughlin, Dr. Francis Townsend, and Huey Long.Every Sunday, Father Charles Coughlin, a Roman Catholic priest from a suburb of Detroit, broadcast radio sermons that combined economic, politi-cal, and religious ideas. Initially a supporter of the New Deal, Coughlin soon turned against Roosevelt. He favored a guaranteed annual income and the nationalization of banks. At the height of his popularity, Father Cough-lin claimed a radio audience of as many as 40–45 million people, but his increasingly anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish) views eventually cost him support. Another critic was Dr. Francis Townsend, a physician and health officer in Long Beach, California. He believed that Roosevelt wasn’t doing enough to help the poor and elderly, so he devised a pension plan that would pro-vide monthly benefits to the aged. The plan found strong backing among the elderly, thus undermining their support for Roosevelt. Perhaps the most serious challenge to the New Deal came from Sena-tor Huey Long of Louisiana. Like Coughlin, Long was an early supporter of the New Deal. But he, too, turned against Roosevelt. Eager to win the presidency for himself, Long proposed a nationwide social program called Share-Our-Wealth. Under the banner slogan “Every Man a King,” he prom-ised something for everyone. Long’s Share-Our-Wealth program was very popular. By 1935 he boasted of having perhaps as many as 27,000 Share-Our-Wealth clubs and 7.5 million members. That same year, however, at the height of his popu-larity, Long was assassinated by a lone gunman.As the initial impetus of the New Deal began to wane, President Roos-evelt started to look ahead. He knew that much more needed to be done to help the people and to solve the nation’s economic problems.
