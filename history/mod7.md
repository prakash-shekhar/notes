# World War I Begins
## Causes of World War
- Although many Americans wanted to stay out of the war, several factors made American neutrality difficult to maintain
- As an industrial and imperial power, the United States felt many of the same pressures that had led the nations of Europe into devastating warfare
- Historians generally cite four long-term causes of World War I: nationalism, imperialism, militarism, and the formation of a system of alliances
### Nationalism
- Throughout the 19th century, politics in the Western world were deeply influenced by the concept of nationalism—a devotion to the interests and culture of one’s nation
- Often, nationalism led to competitive and antagonistic rivalries among nations
- In this atmosphere of competition, many feared Germany’s growing power in Europe
- In addition, various ethnic groups resented domination by others
- They longed for their nations to become independent
- Many ethnic groups looked to larger nations for protection
- Russia regarded itself as the protector of Europe’s Slavic peoples, no matter which government they lived under
- Among these Slavic peoples were the Serbs
- Serbia, located in the Balkans, was an independent nation
- However, millions of ethnic Serbs lived under the rule of Austria-Hungary
- As a result, Russia and Austria-Hungary were rivals for influence over Serbia
### Imperialism
- For many centuries, European nations had been building empires
- These nations had slowly extended their economic and political control over various peoples of the world
- Colonies supplied the European imperial powers with raw materials and provided markets for manufactured goods
- As Germany industrialized, it competed with France and Britain in the contest for colonies
### Militarism
- Empires were expensive to build and to defend
- The growth of nationalism and imperialism led to increased military spending
- Each nation wanted stronger armed forces than those of any potential enemy
- The imperial powers followed a policy of militarism—the development of armed forces and their use as a tool of diplomacy
- By 1890 the strongest nation on the European continent was Germany
- It had set up an army reserve system that drafted and trained young men
- At first, Britain was not alarmed by Germany’s military expansion
- As an island nation, Britain had always relied on its navy for defense and protection of its shipping routes
- In addition, the British navy was the strongest in the world
- However, in 1897 Wilhelm II, Germany’s kaiser, or emperor, decided that his nation should also become a major sea power in order to compete more successfully against the British
- Soon, British and German shipyards competed to build the largest battleships and destroyers
- France, Italy, Japan, and the United States quickly joined the naval arms race
### Alliance System
- By 1907 there were two major defense alliances in Europe
- The Triple Entente, later known as the Allies, consisted of France, Britain, and Russia
- The Triple Alliance consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy
- Germany and Austria-Hungary, together with the Ottoman Empire—an empire of mostly Middle Eastern lands controlled by the Turks—were later known as the Central powers
- Some European leaders believed that these alliances created a balance of power, in which each nation or alliance had equal strength
- Many leaders thought that the alliance system would help decrease the chances of war
- They hoped that no single nation would attack another out of fear that the attacked nation’s allies would join the fight

## War Breaks Out
- Despite their hopes, the major European powers’ long history of national tensions, imperial rivalries, and military expansion proved too great for alliances to overcome
- As it turned out, a single spark set off a major conflict

### An Assassination Leads to War
- That spark flared in the Balkan Peninsula
- This area was known as "the powder keg of Europe"
- In addition to the ethnic rivalries among the Balkan peoples, Europe’s leading powers had interests there
- Russia wanted access to the Mediterranean Sea
- Germany wanted a rail link to the Ottoman Empire
- Austria-Hungary, which had taken control of Bosnia in 1878, accused Serbia of subverting its rule over Bosnia
- The "powder keg" was ready to explode
-In June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, visited the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo
- As the royal entourage drove through the city, Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip stepped from the crowd and shot the Archduke and his wife, Sophie
- Princip was a member of the Black Hand, an organization promoting Serbian nationalism
- The assassinations touched off a diplomatic crisis
- On July 28 Austria-Hungary declared what was expected to be a short war against Serbia
- The alliance system pulled one nation after another into the conflict
- On August 1 Germany, obligated by treaty to support Austria-Hungary, declared war on Russia
- On August 3 Germany declared war on Russia’s ally France
- After Germany invaded Belgium, Britain declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary
- The Great War had begun

### The Fighting Starts
- On August 3, 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, following a strategy known as the Schlieffen Plan
- This plan called for a holding action against Russia, combined with a quick drive through Belgium to Paris
- After France had fallen, the two German armies would defeat Russia
- European leaders were confident of a short war
- Kaiser Wilhelm II even promised German soldiers that they would be home "before the leaves had fallen"
- As German troops swept across Belgium, thousands of civilians fled in terror
- In Brussels, the Belgian capital, an American war correspondent described the first major refugee crisis of the 20th century
- Unable to save Belgium, the Allies retreated to the Marne River in France
- There they halted the German advance in September 1914
- After struggling to outflank each other’s armies, both sides dug in for a long siege
- By the spring of 1915, two parallel systems of deep, rat-infested trenches crossed France
- The trenches stretched from the Belgian coast to the Swiss Alps
- German soldiers occupied one set of trenches, Allied soldiers the other
- The scale of slaughter was horrific
- During the First Battle of the Somme—which began on July 1, 1916, and lasted until mid-November—the British suffered 60,000 casualties the first day alone
- Final casualties totaled about 1,2 million, yet only about seven miles of ground changed hands
- This virtual stalemate lasted for more than three years
- Elsewhere, the fighting was just as devastating and inconclusive

### In the Trenches
- The stalemate was mainly an effect of trench warfare, in which armies fought for mere yards of ground
- On the battlefields of Europe, there were three main kinds of trenches—front line, support, and reserve
- Soldiers spent a period of time in each kind of trench
- Dugouts, or underground rooms, were used as officers’ quarters and command posts
- Between the trench complexes lay "no man’s land"
- This was a barren expanse of mud pockmarked with shell craters and filled with barbed wire
- Periodically, the soldiers charged enemy lines, only to be mowed down by machine-gun fire
- Life in the trenches was miserable
- The soldiers were surrounded by filth, lice, rats, and polluted water that caused dysentery
- Many soldiers suffered trench foot
- This condition was caused by standing in cold, wet trenches for long periods of time without changing into dry socks or boots
- First, the toes would turn red or blue
- Then, they would become numb, and finally, they would start to rot
- The only solution was to amputate the toes, and in some cases, the entire foot
- A painful infection of the gums and throat, called trench mouth, was also common among the soldiers
- The soldiers also suffered from lack of sleep
- Constant bombardments and other experiences often led to battle fatigue and "shell shock"
- This term was coined during World War I to describe a complete emotional collapse from which many never recovered

## Americans Question Neutrality
- Just after the fighting in Europe began, President Woodrow Wilson declared that the United States would remain neutral
- His statement reflected a long-standing American commitment to isolationism
- Most Americans agreed that there was no reason to join a struggle 3,000 miles away
- The war did not threaten American lives or property
- This did not mean, however, that certain groups and individuals in the United States were indifferent to who would win the war
- Public opinion was strong—but divided
### Divided Loyalties
- Socialists criticized the war as a capitalist and imperialist struggle between Germany and England to control markets and colonies in China, Africa, and the Middle East
- Pacifists, such as lawyer and politician William Jennings Bryan, believed that war was evil and that the United States should set an example of peace to the world
- Many Americans simply did not want their sons to experience the horrors of warfare, as a hit song of 1915 conveyed
- Millions of naturalized US citizens followed the war closely because they still had ties to the nations from which they had emigrated
- For example, many Americans of German descent sympathized with Germany
- Americans of Irish descent remembered the centuries of British oppression in Ireland
- They saw the war as a chance for Ireland to gain its independence
- Pressure from some of these ethnic groups in the United States contributed to American neutrality
- Some immigrants created organizations to help the causes of their homelands
- Some even advised the government on policies that affected the people of their homelands
- On the other hand, many Americans felt close to Britain because of a common ancestry and language as well as similar democratic institutions and legal systems
- Germany’s aggressive sweep through Belgium increased American sympathy for the Allies
- The Germans attacked civilians, destroying villages, cathedrals, libraries, and even hospitals
- Some atrocity stories—spread by British propaganda—later proved to be false
- However, enough proved true that one American magazine referred to Germany as “the bully of Europe" Maintaining neutrality proved difficult for American businesses
- America’s economic ties with the Allies were far stronger than its ties with the Central powers
- Before the war, American trade with Britain and France was more than double its trade with Germany
- With the start of the war, America’s transatlantic trade became even more lopsided
- The Allies flooded American manufacturers with orders for all sorts of war supplies
- These included dynamite, cannon powder, submarines, copper wire and tubing, and armored cars
- The United States shipped millions of dollars of war supplies to the Allies, but requests kept coming
- By 1915 American factories were producing so many supplies for the Allies that the United States was experiencing a labor shortage
-Some businesses, seeking to remain neutral, tried to continue dealing with Germany, but this trade became increasingly risky
- Shipments were often stopped by the British navy
- In addition, President Wilson and others spoke out against German atrocities and warned of the threat that the German empire posed to democracy
- From 1914 on, trade with the Allies quadrupled, while trade with Germany fell to near zero
- Also, by 1917 American banks had loaned $2,3 billion to the Allies, but only $27 million to the Central powers
- Many US leaders, including Treasury secretary William McAdoo, felt that American prosperity depended upon an Allied victory


## The War Hits Home
- Although the majority of Americans favored victory for the Allies rather than the Central powers, they did not want to join the Allies’ fight
- By 1917, however, America had mobilized for war against the Central powers in order to ensure Allied repayment of debts to the United States and to prevent the Germans from threatening US shipping
### The British Blockade
- As fighting on land continued, Britain began to make more use of its naval strength
- It blockaded the German coast to prevent weapons and other military supplies from getting through
- However, the British expanded the definition of contraband to include food
- They also extended the blockade to neutral ports and mined the entire North Sea
- The results were twofold
- First, American ships carrying goods for Germany refused to challenge the blockade and seldom reached their destination
- Second, Germany found it increasingly difficult to import foodstuff and fertilizers for crops
- By 1917 famine stalked the country
- An estimated 750,000 Germans starved to death as a result of the British blockade
- Americans had been angry at Britain’s blockade
- It threatened freedom of the seas and prevented American goods from reaching German ports
- However, Germany’s response to the blockade soon outraged Americans
### German U-Boat Response
- Germany responded to the British blockade with a counterblockade by U-boats (from Unterseeboot, the German word for submarine)
- Any British or Allied ship found in the waters around Britain would be sunk—and it would not always be possible to warn crews and passengers of an attack
- One of the worst disasters occurred on May 7, 1915, when a U-­boat sank the British liner Lusitania (loo´sĭ-taʹnē-ә) off the Irish coast
- Of the 1,198 persons lost, 128 were Americans
- The Germans defended their action on the grounds that the liner carried ammunition
- Despite Germany’s explanation, Americans became outraged with Germany because of the loss of life
- American public opinion turned against Germany and the Central powers
- Despite this provocation, President Wilson ruled out a military response in favor of a sharp protest to Germany
- Three months later, in August 1915, a U-boat sank another British liner, the Arabic, drowning two Americans
- Again the United States protested, and this time Germany agreed not to sink any more passenger ships
- But in March 1916 Germany broke its promise and torpedoed an unarmed French passenger steamer, the Sussex
- The Sussex sank, and about 80 passengers, including Americans, were killed or injured
- After this attack, Wilson threatened to end diplomatic relations with Germany unless it stopped killing innocent civilians
- German officials feared that the United States might enter the war, so Germany issued the Sussex pledge, which included a promise not to sink merchant vessels “without warning and without saving human lives" But there was a condition: if the United States could not persuade Britain to lift its blockade against food and fertilizers, Germany would consider renewing unrestricted submarine warfare
### The 1916 Election
- In November 1916 came the US presidential election
- The Democrats renominated Wilson, and the Republicans nominated Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes
- Wilson campaigned on the slogan “He Kept Us Out of War" Hughes pledged to uphold America’s right to freedom of the seas but also promised not to be too severe on Germany
- The election returns shifted from hour to hour
- In fact, Hughes went to bed believing he had been elected
- When a reporter tried to reach him with the news of Wilson’s victory, an aide said, “The president can’t be disturbed" “Well," replied the reporter, “when he wakes up, tell him he’s no longer president"

## The United States declares War
- Despite Wilson’s efforts on behalf of peace, hope seemed lost
- The Allies were angered by Wilson’s request for “peace without victory" They blamed the Central powers for starting the war and wanted them to pay for wartime damage and destruction
- Germany, too, ignored Wilson’s call for peace
### German Provocations
- Germany’s leaders hoped to defeat Britain by resuming unrestricted submarine warfare
- On January 31 the kaiser announced that U-boats would sink all ships in British waters—hostile or neutral—on sight
- Wilson was stunned
- The German decision meant that the United States would have to go to war
- However, the president held back, saying that he would wait for “actual overt acts" before declaring war
- The overt acts came
- First was the Zimmermann note, a secret telegram from the German foreign minister to the German ambassador in Mexico that was intercepted and decoded by British agents
- The telegram proposed an alliance between Mexico and Germany and promised that if war with the United States broke out, Germany would support Mexico in recapturing areas that Mexico had lost during the Mexican-American War
- The Germans hoped that an American war with Mexico would keep the United States out of the war in Europe
- Excerpts of the telegram were printed in newspapers
- The American public was outraged
- On top of this, the Germans sank four unarmed American merchant ships, with a loss of 36 lives, further angering Americans
### A Revolution in Russia
- Meanwhile, events in Russia also troubled the United States
- By the end of 1915 Russia had suffered about 2,5 million casualties in the fight against the Central powers and was experiencing massive food shortages
- Blaming the Russian czar for the nation’s losses, revolutionaries ousted him in March 1917 and established a provisional government
- In November, a group known as the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government and set up a Communist state
- The new government withdrew the Russian army from the eastern front and signed a peace agreement with the Central powers
- With Russia out of the conflict, Germany was free to focus on fighting in the west
- It looked as if Germany had a chance of winning the war
- These events removed the last significant obstacle to direct US involvement in the war
- Now supporters of American entry into the war could claim that this was a war of democracies against brutal monarchies
### America Acts
- A light drizzle fell on Washington on April 2, 1917, as senators, representatives, ambassadors, members of the Supreme Court, and other guests crowded into the Capitol to hear President Wilson deliver his war resolution
- Congress passed the resolution a few days later
- With the hope of neutrality finally shattered, US troops would follow the stream of American money and munitions that had been heading to the Allies throughout the war
- But Wilson’s plea to make the world “safe for democracy" wasn’t just political posturing
- Indeed, Wilson and many Americans truly believed that the United States had to join the war to pave the way for a future order of peace and freedom
- A resolved but anxious nation held its breath as the United States prepared for war
