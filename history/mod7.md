# World War I Begins
## Causes of World War
- Although many Americans wanted to stay out of the war, several factors made American neutrality difficult to maintain
- As an industrial and imperial power, the United States felt many of the same pressures that had led the nations of Europe into devastating warfare
- Historians generally cite four long-term causes of World War I: nationalism, imperialism, militarism, and the formation of a system of alliances
### Nationalism
- Throughout the 19th century, politics in the Western world were deeply influenced by the concept of nationalism—a devotion to the interests and culture of one’s nation
- Often, nationalism led to competitive and antagonistic rivalries among nations
- In this atmosphere of competition, many feared Germany’s growing power in Europe
- In addition, various ethnic groups resented domination by others
- They longed for their nations to become independent
- Many ethnic groups looked to larger nations for protection
- Russia regarded itself as the protector of Europe’s Slavic peoples, no matter which government they lived under
- Among these Slavic peoples were the Serbs
- Serbia, located in the Balkans, was an independent nation
- However, millions of ethnic Serbs lived under the rule of Austria-Hungary
- As a result, Russia and Austria-Hungary were rivals for influence over Serbia
### Imperialism
- For many centuries, European nations had been building empires
- These nations had slowly extended their economic and political control over various peoples of the world
- Colonies supplied the European imperial powers with raw materials and provided markets for manufactured goods
- As Germany industrialized, it competed with France and Britain in the contest for colonies
### Militarism
- Empires were expensive to build and to defend
- The growth of nationalism and imperialism led to increased military spending
- Each nation wanted stronger armed forces than those of any potential enemy
- The imperial powers followed a policy of militarism—the development of armed forces and their use as a tool of diplomacy
- By 1890 the strongest nation on the European continent was Germany
- It had set up an army reserve system that drafted and trained young men
- At first, Britain was not alarmed by Germany’s military expansion
- As an island nation, Britain had always relied on its navy for defense and protection of its shipping routes
- In addition, the British navy was the strongest in the world
- However, in 1897 Wilhelm II, Germany’s kaiser, or emperor, decided that his nation should also become a major sea power in order to compete more successfully against the British
- Soon, British and German shipyards competed to build the largest battleships and destroyers
- France, Italy, Japan, and the United States quickly joined the naval arms race
### Alliance System
- By 1907 there were two major defense alliances in Europe
- The Triple Entente, later known as the Allies, consisted of France, Britain, and Russia
- The Triple Alliance consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy
- Germany and Austria-Hungary, together with the Ottoman Empire—an empire of mostly Middle Eastern lands controlled by the Turks—were later known as the Central powers
- Some European leaders believed that these alliances created a balance of power, in which each nation or alliance had equal strength
- Many leaders thought that the alliance system would help decrease the chances of war
- They hoped that no single nation would attack another out of fear that the attacked nation’s allies would join the fight

## War Breaks Out
- Despite their hopes, the major European powers’ long history of national tensions, imperial rivalries, and military expansion proved too great for alliances to overcome
- As it turned out, a single spark set off a major conflict

### An Assassination Leads to War
- That spark flared in the Balkan Peninsula
- This area was known as "the powder keg of Europe"
- In addition to the ethnic rivalries among the Balkan peoples, Europe’s leading powers had interests there
- Russia wanted access to the Mediterranean Sea
- Germany wanted a rail link to the Ottoman Empire
- Austria-Hungary, which had taken control of Bosnia in 1878, accused Serbia of subverting its rule over Bosnia
- The "powder keg" was ready to explode
-In June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, visited the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo
- As the royal entourage drove through the city, Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip stepped from the crowd and shot the Archduke and his wife, Sophie
- Princip was a member of the Black Hand, an organization promoting Serbian nationalism
- The assassinations touched off a diplomatic crisis
- On July 28 Austria-Hungary declared what was expected to be a short war against Serbia
- The alliance system pulled one nation after another into the conflict
- On August 1 Germany, obligated by treaty to support Austria-Hungary, declared war on Russia
- On August 3 Germany declared war on Russia’s ally France
- After Germany invaded Belgium, Britain declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary
- The Great War had begun

### The Fighting Starts
- On August 3, 1914, Germany invaded Belgium, following a strategy known as the Schlieffen Plan
- This plan called for a holding action against Russia, combined with a quick drive through Belgium to Paris
- After France had fallen, the two German armies would defeat Russia
- European leaders were confident of a short war
- Kaiser Wilhelm II even promised German soldiers that they would be home "before the leaves had fallen"
- As German troops swept across Belgium, thousands of civilians fled in terror
- In Brussels, the Belgian capital, an American war correspondent described the first major refugee crisis of the 20th century
- Unable to save Belgium, the Allies retreated to the Marne River in France
- There they halted the German advance in September 1914
- After struggling to outflank each other’s armies, both sides dug in for a long siege
- By the spring of 1915, two parallel systems of deep, rat-infested trenches crossed France
- The trenches stretched from the Belgian coast to the Swiss Alps
- German soldiers occupied one set of trenches, Allied soldiers the other
- The scale of slaughter was horrific
- During the First Battle of the Somme—which began on July 1, 1916, and lasted until mid-November—the British suffered 60,000 casualties the first day alone
- Final casualties totaled about 1,2 million, yet only about seven miles of ground changed hands
- This virtual stalemate lasted for more than three years
- Elsewhere, the fighting was just as devastating and inconclusive

### In the Trenches
- The stalemate was mainly an effect of trench warfare, in which armies fought for mere yards of ground
- On the battlefields of Europe, there were three main kinds of trenches—front line, support, and reserve
- Soldiers spent a period of time in each kind of trench
- Dugouts, or underground rooms, were used as officers’ quarters and command posts
- Between the trench complexes lay "no man’s land"
- This was a barren expanse of mud pockmarked with shell craters and filled with barbed wire
- Periodically, the soldiers charged enemy lines, only to be mowed down by machine-gun fire
- Life in the trenches was miserable
- The soldiers were surrounded by filth, lice, rats, and polluted water that caused dysentery
- Many soldiers suffered trench foot
- This condition was caused by standing in cold, wet trenches for long periods of time without changing into dry socks or boots
- First, the toes would turn red or blue
- Then, they would become numb, and finally, they would start to rot
- The only solution was to amputate the toes, and in some cases, the entire foot
- A painful infection of the gums and throat, called trench mouth, was also common among the soldiers
- The soldiers also suffered from lack of sleep
- Constant bombardments and other experiences often led to battle fatigue and "shell shock"
- This term was coined during World War I to describe a complete emotional collapse from which many never recovered

## Americans Question Neutrality
- Just after the fighting in Europe began, President Woodrow Wilson declared that the United States would remain neutral
- His statement reflected a long-standing American commitment to isolationism
- Most Americans agreed that there was no reason to join a struggle 3,000 miles away
- The war did not threaten American lives or property
- This did not mean, however, that certain groups and individuals in the United States were indifferent to who would win the war
- Public opinion was strong—but divided
### Divided Loyalties
- Socialists criticized the war as a capitalist and imperialist struggle between Germany and England to control markets and colonies in China, Africa, and the Middle East
- Pacifists, such as lawyer and politician William Jennings Bryan, believed that war was evil and that the United States should set an example of peace to the world
- Many Americans simply did not want their sons to experience the horrors of warfare, as a hit song of 1915 conveyed
- Millions of naturalized US citizens followed the war closely because they still had ties to the nations from which they had emigrated
- For example, many Americans of German descent sympathized with Germany
- Americans of Irish descent remembered the centuries of British oppression in Ireland
- They saw the war as a chance for Ireland to gain its independence
- Pressure from some of these ethnic groups in the United States contributed to American neutrality
- Some immigrants created organizations to help the causes of their homelands
- Some even advised the government on policies that affected the people of their homelands
- On the other hand, many Americans felt close to Britain because of a common ancestry and language as well as similar democratic institutions and legal systems
- Germany’s aggressive sweep through Belgium increased American sympathy for the Allies
- The Germans attacked civilians, destroying villages, cathedrals, libraries, and even hospitals
- Some atrocity stories—spread by British propaganda—later proved to be false
- However, enough proved true that one American magazine referred to Germany as “the bully of Europe" Maintaining neutrality proved difficult for American businesses
- America’s economic ties with the Allies were far stronger than its ties with the Central powers
- Before the war, American trade with Britain and France was more than double its trade with Germany
- With the start of the war, America’s transatlantic trade became even more lopsided
- The Allies flooded American manufacturers with orders for all sorts of war supplies
- These included dynamite, cannon powder, submarines, copper wire and tubing, and armored cars
- The United States shipped millions of dollars of war supplies to the Allies, but requests kept coming
- By 1915 American factories were producing so many supplies for the Allies that the United States was experiencing a labor shortage
-Some businesses, seeking to remain neutral, tried to continue dealing with Germany, but this trade became increasingly risky
- Shipments were often stopped by the British navy
- In addition, President Wilson and others spoke out against German atrocities and warned of the threat that the German empire posed to democracy
- From 1914 on, trade with the Allies quadrupled, while trade with Germany fell to near zero
- Also, by 1917 American banks had loaned $2,3 billion to the Allies, but only $27 million to the Central powers
- Many US leaders, including Treasury secretary William McAdoo, felt that American prosperity depended upon an Allied victory


## The War Hits Home
- Although the majority of Americans favored victory for the Allies rather than the Central powers, they did not want to join the Allies’ fight
- By 1917, however, America had mobilized for war against the Central powers in order to ensure Allied repayment of debts to the United States and to prevent the Germans from threatening US shipping
### The British Blockade
- As fighting on land continued, Britain began to make more use of its naval strength
- It blockaded the German coast to prevent weapons and other military supplies from getting through
- However, the British expanded the definition of contraband to include food
- They also extended the blockade to neutral ports and mined the entire North Sea
- The results were twofold
- First, American ships carrying goods for Germany refused to challenge the blockade and seldom reached their destination
- Second, Germany found it increasingly difficult to import foodstuff and fertilizers for crops
- By 1917 famine stalked the country
- An estimated 750,000 Germans starved to death as a result of the British blockade
- Americans had been angry at Britain’s blockade
- It threatened freedom of the seas and prevented American goods from reaching German ports
- However, Germany’s response to the blockade soon outraged Americans
### German U-Boat Response
- Germany responded to the British blockade with a counterblockade by U-boats (from Unterseeboot, the German word for submarine)
- Any British or Allied ship found in the waters around Britain would be sunk—and it would not always be possible to warn crews and passengers of an attack
- One of the worst disasters occurred on May 7, 1915, when a U-­boat sank the British liner Lusitania (loo´sĭ-taʹnē-ә) off the Irish coast
- Of the 1,198 persons lost, 128 were Americans
- The Germans defended their action on the grounds that the liner carried ammunition
- Despite Germany’s explanation, Americans became outraged with Germany because of the loss of life
- American public opinion turned against Germany and the Central powers
- Despite this provocation, President Wilson ruled out a military response in favor of a sharp protest to Germany
- Three months later, in August 1915, a U-boat sank another British liner, the Arabic, drowning two Americans
- Again the United States protested, and this time Germany agreed not to sink any more passenger ships
- But in March 1916 Germany broke its promise and torpedoed an unarmed French passenger steamer, the Sussex
- The Sussex sank, and about 80 passengers, including Americans, were killed or injured
- After this attack, Wilson threatened to end diplomatic relations with Germany unless it stopped killing innocent civilians
- German officials feared that the United States might enter the war, so Germany issued the Sussex pledge, which included a promise not to sink merchant vessels “without warning and without saving human lives" But there was a condition: if the United States could not persuade Britain to lift its blockade against food and fertilizers, Germany would consider renewing unrestricted submarine warfare
### The 1916 Election
- In November 1916 came the US presidential election
- The Democrats renominated Wilson, and the Republicans nominated Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes
- Wilson campaigned on the slogan “He Kept Us Out of War" Hughes pledged to uphold America’s right to freedom of the seas but also promised not to be too severe on Germany
- The election returns shifted from hour to hour
- In fact, Hughes went to bed believing he had been elected
- When a reporter tried to reach him with the news of Wilson’s victory, an aide said, “The president can’t be disturbed" “Well," replied the reporter, “when he wakes up, tell him he’s no longer president"

## The United States declares War
- Despite Wilson’s efforts on behalf of peace, hope seemed lost
- The Allies were angered by Wilson’s request for “peace without victory" They blamed the Central powers for starting the war and wanted them to pay for wartime damage and destruction
- Germany, too, ignored Wilson’s call for peace
### German Provocations
- Germany’s leaders hoped to defeat Britain by resuming unrestricted submarine warfare
- On January 31 the kaiser announced that U-boats would sink all ships in British waters—hostile or neutral—on sight
- Wilson was stunned
- The German decision meant that the United States would have to go to war
- However, the president held back, saying that he would wait for “actual overt acts" before declaring war
- The overt acts came
- First was the Zimmermann note, a secret telegram from the German foreign minister to the German ambassador in Mexico that was intercepted and decoded by British agents
- The telegram proposed an alliance between Mexico and Germany and promised that if war with the United States broke out, Germany would support Mexico in recapturing areas that Mexico had lost during the Mexican-American War
- The Germans hoped that an American war with Mexico would keep the United States out of the war in Europe
- Excerpts of the telegram were printed in newspapers
- The American public was outraged
- On top of this, the Germans sank four unarmed American merchant ships, with a loss of 36 lives, further angering Americans
### A Revolution in Russia
- Meanwhile, events in Russia also troubled the United States
- By the end of 1915 Russia had suffered about 2,5 million casualties in the fight against the Central powers and was experiencing massive food shortages
- Blaming the Russian czar for the nation’s losses, revolutionaries ousted him in March 1917 and established a provisional government
- In November, a group known as the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government and set up a Communist state
- The new government withdrew the Russian army from the eastern front and signed a peace agreement with the Central powers
- With Russia out of the conflict, Germany was free to focus on fighting in the west
- It looked as if Germany had a chance of winning the war
- These events removed the last significant obstacle to direct US involvement in the war
- Now supporters of American entry into the war could claim that this was a war of democracies against brutal monarchies
### America Acts
- A light drizzle fell on Washington on April 2, 1917, as senators, representatives, ambassadors, members of the Supreme Court, and other guests crowded into the Capitol to hear President Wilson deliver his war resolution
- Congress passed the resolution a few days later
- With the hope of neutrality finally shattered, US troops would follow the stream of American money and munitions that had been heading to the Allies throughout the war
- But Wilson’s plea to make the world “safe for democracy" wasn’t just political posturing
- Indeed, Wilson and many Americans truly believed that the United States had to join the war to pave the way for a future order of peace and freedom
- A resolved but anxious nation held its breath as the United States prepared for war

# The United States Joins the War
## America Mobilizes
### Raising An Army
To meet the government’s need for more fighting power, Congress passed the Selective Service Act in May 1917. The act required men to register with the government in order to be randomly selected for military service. By the end of 1918, 24 million men had registered under the act. Of this number, almost 3 million were called up. About 2 million troops reached Europe before the truce was signed, and three-fourths of them saw actual combat. Most of the inductees had not attended high school, and about one in five was foreign-born. The eight-month training period took place partly in the United States and partly in Europe. During this time, the men put in 17-hour days on target practice, bayonet drill, kitchen duty, and cleaning up the grounds. Since real weapons were in short supply, soldiers often drilled with fake weapons. They used rocks instead of hand grenades or wooden poles instead of rifles.
### Diversity in Military
For the United States to effectively fight the Central powers, its military needed the cooperation of its minority population. Government publications appealed to all Americans, regardless of race or ethnicity, to support the war effort. One pamphlet reminded Americans that “. . . black men, yellow men, white men, from all quarters of the globe, are fighting side by side to free the world from the Hun peril. That’s the patriotism of equality!” Many minorities hoped that by fighting for America, they would gain respect and be treated as equal citizens to whites. One lieutenant in the all-black 369th Infantry Regiment explained this perspective to a reporter. About 400,000 African Americans would ultimately serve in the armed forces. They generally did not get the equal treatment they wanted, however. They served in segregated units and were excluded from the navy and marines. Many white army officers and southern politicians objected to training African American soldiers to use weapons. They feared that these black soldiers might pose a threat after the war. Most African Americans were assigned to noncombat duties, although there were exceptions. The 369th Infantry Regiment saw more continuous duty on the front lines than any other American regiment. Two soldiers of the 369th, Henry Johnson and Needham Roberts, were the first Americans to receive France’s highest military honor, the Croix de Guerre—the “cross of war.” Native Americans were required to register for the draft, but at the time were not generally considered to be citizens. Nonetheless, an estimated 10,000 Native Americans served in the military during the war. Many did so eager to gain war honors and maintain the warrior traditions of their peoples. The army used some Choctaw Indians to transmit messages in their native language. This was a strategy that the US military would use more extensively in the next world war. Other minority groups also contributed to the war effort. Like African Americans, many Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans saw military service as a way to gain equal rights. To accommodate Hispanic soldiers who did not speak fluent English, the military established programs in New Mexico and Georgia to help them learn the language. The Jewish Welfare Board established centers for Jewish servicemen in the United States and overseas. It also led enlistment and fundraising campaigns for the war effort. Although women were not allowed to enlist, the army reluctantly accepted women in the Army Corps of Nurses. However, it denied them army rank, pay, and benefits. Meanwhile, some 13,000 women accepted noncombat positions in the navy and marines. There they served as nurses, secretaries, and telephone operators with full military rank. Some French-speaking American women served in the US Army Signal Corps as switchboard operators. These “Hello Girls” served a crucial role by keeping communications open between the front line and the military headquarters. Some women went overseas to serve as volunteer ambulance drivers on the front lines.
### Mass Production
In addition to the vast army that had to be created and trained, the United States had to transport men, food, and equipment over thousands of miles of ocean. But German U-boat attacks on merchant ships in the Atlantic were a serious threat to the Allied war effort. By early 1917 German submarines had sunk twice as much ship tonnage as the Allies had built. In response, the US government took several steps to expand its fleet. First, the government exempted many shipyard workers from the draft. It gave others a “deferred” classification, delaying their participation in the draft. Second, the US Chamber of Commerce joined in a public relations campaign to emphasize the importance of shipyard work. They distributed service flags to families of shipyard workers, just like the flags given to families of soldiers and sailors. Finally, shipyards used prefabrication techniques. Instead of building an entire ship in the yard, standardized parts were built elsewhere and then assembled at the yard. This method reduced construction time substantially.
## The Fight "Over There"
### The Convoy System
Mass production techniques greatly increased the number of ships hauling materials and personnel to Europe. However, those ships remained easy targets for prowling U-boats. The United States needed to figure out a way to protect its transatlantic shipping. American vice-admiral William S. Sims convinced the British to try the convoy system. This method involved a heavy guard of destroyers escorting merchant ships back and forth across the Atlantic in groups. By fall of 1917 shipping losses had been cut in half. The US Navy also helped lay a 230-mile barrier of mines across the North Sea from Scotland to Norway. The barrier was designed to bottle up the U-boats that sailed from German ports and keep them out of the Atlantic Ocean. By early 1918 the Germans found it increasingly difficult to replace their losses and to staff their fleet with trained submariners. Of the almost 2 million Americans who sailed to Europe during the war, only 637 were lost to U-boat attacks.
### THe American Expeditionary Force
The first US troops arrived in France in late June 1917. The American soldiers who went overseas formed the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), which was led by General John J. Pershing. The AEF included soldiers from the regular army, the National Guard, and a new larger force of volunteers and draftees. The men came from all over the country. Many had never traveled much beyond the farms or small towns where they lived. These American infantrymen were nicknamed doughboys, possibly because of the white belts they wore, which they cleaned with pipe clay, or “dough.”
### A new kind of war
Not only did World War I see the use of trench warfare, but it saw the first large-scale use of weapons that would become standard in modern war. Although some of these weapons were new, others, like the machine gun, had been so refined that they changed the nature of warfare. The new guns could hit targets that were miles away. And capable of firing 600 rounds a minute, machine guns could inflict heavy casualties on the enemy. In fact, they were responsible for 90 percent of Allied casualties at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The two most innovative weapons were the tank and the airplane. Together, they heralded mechanized warfare, or warfare that relies on machines powered by gasoline and diesel engines. Tanks ran on caterpillar treads and were built of steel so that bullets bounced off. The British first used tanks at Somme, but not very effectively. By 1917 the British had learned how to drive large numbers of tanks through barbed-wire defenses, clearing a path for the infantry. Because tanks were not damaged by either machine-gun or rifle fire, their use would mark the eventual end of trench warfare. When the United States entered the war, its air power was weak. Congress eventually appropriated $675 million to build an air force. The early airplanes were so flimsy that at first both sides limited their use to scouting. After a while, the two sides used tanks to fire at enemy planes that were gathering information. Early dogfights, or individual air combats, like the one described by Eddie Rickenbacker, resembled duels. Pilots sat in their open cockpits and shot at each other with pistols. Because it was hard to fly a plane and shoot a pistol at the same time, planes began carrying mounted machine guns. But the planes’ propeller blades kept getting in the way of the bullets. Then the Germans introduced an interrupter gear, which permitted the stream of bullets to avoid the whirring blades. Meanwhile, airplanes were built to travel faster and carry heavy bomb loads. By 1918 the British had built up a strategic bomber force of 22,000 planes. This force attacked German weapons factories and army bases. The Allies and the Central powers also poured valuable resources into building a new type of battleship called a dreadnought. These ships were more heavily armed than any other battleship. They also featured a revolutionary steam turbine propulsion system that gave them speed. Observation balloons were widely used by both sides in the war in Europe. Balloons were so important strategically that they were often protected by aircraft. They became prime targets for Rickenbacker and other ace pilots. Armies also used chemical warfare during World War I. Slow-moving clouds of poison gas could reach soldiers sheltered in the deepest of trenches. Toxic tear gas, mustard gas, chlorine, and phosgene were all used to deadly effect. This led some historians to call World War I the “chemists’ war.” Today the use of poison gas is a war crime.
## American Troops Go on the Offensive
### American War Hero
During the fighting in the Meuse-Argonne area, one of America’s greatest war heroes, Alvin York, became famous. York sought exemption as a conscientious objector, a person who opposes warfare on moral grounds, pointing out that the Bible says, “Thou shalt not kill.” York eventually decided that it was morally acceptable to fight if the cause was just. On October 8, 1918, armed only with a rifle and a revolver, York killed 25 Germans and—with 6 other doughboys—captured 132 prisoners. General Pershing called him the outstanding soldier of the AEF, while Marshal Foch, the commander of Allied forces in Europe, described his feat as “the greatest thing accomplished by any private soldier of all the armies of Europe.” For his heroic acts, York was promoted to sergeant and became a celebrity when he returned to the United States.
### The Collapse of Germany
By late 1918 the war was crippling the German economy; many civilians lacked food and supplies. Food riots and strikes erupted in Germany, and revolution swept across Austria-Hungary. The Central powers had difficulty encouraging their soldiers to fight. On November 3, 1918, Austria-Hungary surrendered to the Allies. That same day, German sailors mutinied against government authority. The mutiny spread quickly. Everywhere in Germany, groups of soldiers and workers organized revolutionary councils. On November 9 socialist leaders in the capital, Berlin, established a German republic. The kaiser gave up the throne. Although there were no Allied soldiers on German territory and no truly decisive battle had been fought, the Germans were too exhausted to continue fighting. So at the 11th hour, on the 11th day, in the 11th month of 1918, Germany agreed to a cease-fire and signed the armistice, or truce, that ended the war.
### The Final Toll
World War I was the bloodiest war in history up to that time. Deaths numbered about 22 million, more than half of them civilians. In addition, 20 million people were wounded, and 10 million more became refugees. The direct economic costs of the war may have been about $338 billion. The United States lost 48,000 men in battle, with another 62,000 dying of disease. More than 200,000 Americans were wounded.

# The War at Home
## Government Oversees the War Effort
### COngress Gives Power to Wilson
Because World War I was such an immense conflict, the entire economy had to be refocused on the war effort. The shift from producing consumer goods to producing war supplies was too complicated and important a job for private industry to handle on its own, so business and government collaborated in the effort. In the process, the power of government was greatly expanded. Congress gave President Wilson direct control over much of the economy. It gave him the power to fix prices and to regulate—even to nationalize—certain war-related industries. One of the first industries to be nationalized was shipping. The government took over commercial and private ships and converted them for transatlantic war use. The main regulatory body was the War Industries Board (WIB). It was established in 1917 and reorganized in 1918 under the leadership of Bernard M. Baruch (bә-rkʹ), a prosperous businessman. The board encouraged companies to use mass-production techniques to increase efficiency. It also urged them to eliminate waste by standardizing products— for instance, by making only 5 colors of typewriter ribbons instead of 150. The WIB set production quotas and allocated raw materials.

## The Legacy of the War
When World War I ended, many Americans looked forward to a return of what Warren G. Harding called “normalcy.” However, both the United States and the rest of the world had been utterly transformed by the war. World War I had devastated many European economies. The war had also revealed the military and industrial potential of the United States. The combination of these factors meant that the United States emerged from the war as a new world power. The war had strengthened the power of government in the United States. It had also accelerated social change, especially for African Americans and women. In addition, the propaganda campaign had provoked powerful fears and antagonisms that were left unchanneled when the war finally came to an end. In Europe, the destruction and massive loss of life severely damaged social and political systems. In many countries, the war created political instability and violence that persisted for decades. During the war years, the first Communist state was established in Russia, while after the war, militant fascist organizations seized control in Italy, Spain, and Germany. Americans began to call World War I “the war to end all wars,” in the hope that humanity would never again fight such a war. Although the United States had returned mostly to a policy of isolationism, unresolved issues in Europe would eventually drag America into an even wider war. The Treaty of Versailles had settled nothing. The redrawn maps of Europe and European colonial possessions created a new set of problems. In addition, the reparations imposed on Germany had crippled its economy, and the war-guilt clause caused much anger and hostility there. In fact, some European nations longed to resume the fight, and the League of Nations did not have the power to stop them. The ominous shape of things to come emerged in the writings of an Austrian named Adolf Hitler, an angry veteran of World War I. Two decades after the end of the Great War, Adolf Hitler’s desire for vengeance would plunge the world into an even greater war, in which the United States would play a leading role.
