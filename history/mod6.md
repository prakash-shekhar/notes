# Imperialism and America
## American Expansionism
- Americans had always sought to expand the size of their nation, and throughout the 19th century they extended their control toward the Pacific Ocean. 
- Their successes in increasing trade and expanding territory in the 1840s and 1850s eventually led to even greater efforts to spread U.S. influence around the world.
### Early Encounters
- As the United States expanded west in the mid-19th century, new port cities on the Pacific coast gave the nation the opportunity to expand its global trade network as well. 
- The potential for profits from trade with China and Japan motivated U.S. officials to extend the country’s reach into the Pacific and attempt to formalize diplomatic relations. 
- Though China initially resisted trade with Westerners, in the 1840s U.S. officials signed the Treaty of Wangxia to protect U.S. business interests in the region. 
- Like China, Japan was resistant to trade with Western nations. 
- Though British, French, Russian, and American ships occasionally anchored off the Japanese coast, Japan repeatedly refused to meet with their representatives. 
- However, the appeal of trade with Japan proved too great for the United States to give up. 
- In addition to wanting to open Japanese ports to trade, the United States also wanted to secure vital coaling stations that could be used to refuel U.S. trade ships and warships in the Pacific. 
- On July 8, 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay with four warships to open negotiations with the Japanese. 
- This thinly veiled threat of military force convinced the Japanese government to negotiate. 
- The next year, the two countries signed the Treaty of Kanagawa, which opened up two Japanese ports for refueling. 
- In 1858 Japan signed the Harris Treaty, opening its ports to trade. 
- At the same time, some Americans were also looking for ways to increase U.S. involvement and territory in Central America and the Caribbean. 
- They had little success until the Mexican-American War. 
- After the land gains of the 1840s and 1850s, the idea of increasing U.S. territory appealed to many Americans. 
- Over time, more and more Americans began to side with the interventionists, or those willing to interfere with the economic, political, or social affairs of other nations. 
- By the 1880s U.S. leaders were convinced that the United States should join the imperialist powers of Europe, establishing overseas colonies and spreading America’s global influence. 
- Imperialism—the policy in which stronger nations extend their economic, political, or military control over weaker territories.
### Global Competition
- European nations had been establishing colonies for centuries. 
- In the late 19th century, Africa had emerged as a prime target of European expansionism. 
- By the early 20th century, only two countries in all of Africa—Ethiopia and Liberia—remained independent. 
- Imperialists also competed for territory in Asia, especially in China. 
- In its late 19th-century reform era, Japan replaced its old feudal order with a strong central government. 
- Hoping that military strength would bolster industrialization, Japan joined European nations in competition for China in the 1890s. 
- Feelings of nationalism, or national pride, in the United States grew as well. 
- Many Americans believed in the superiority of America’s political and cultural ideals. 
- With a belief in manifest destiny, they already had pushed the U.S. border to the Pacific Ocean. 
- Spreading America’s ideals overseas was the next logical step. 
- As Americans gradually warmed to the idea of overseas expansion, three factors fueled the new American imperialism:
    - desire for military strength
    - thirst for new markets
    - belief in cultural superiority
### Desire for Military Strength
- Seeing that other nations were establishing a global military presence, American leaders advised that the United States build up its own military strength. 
- One such leader was Admiral Alfred T. Mahan of the U.S. Navy. 
- Mahan urged government officials to build up American naval power in order to compete with other powerful nations. 
- As a result of the urging of Mahan and others, the United States built nine steel-hulled cruisers between 1883 and 1890. 
- The construction of modern battleships such as the Maine and the Oregon transformed the country into the world’s third-largest naval power.
### The Influence of Sea Power Upon History
- The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660–1783 (published in 1890)is a book by Alfred Mahan, where he calls for the United States to develop a modern fleet capable of protecting American business and shipping interests around the world.
- He also urged the United States to establish naval bases in the Caribbean, to construct a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, and to acquire Hawaii and other Pacific islands.
### Thirst for New Markets
- In the late 19th century, advances in technology enabled American farms and factories to produce far more than American citizens could consume. 
- For example, plows, harrows, threshing machines, and reapers increased corn production by 264 percent and the wheat harvest by 252 percent. 
- Now the United States needed raw materials for its factories and new markets for its agricultural and manufactured goods. 
- Imperialists viewed foreign trade as the solution to American overproduction and the related problems of unemployment and economic depression. 
- They felt that a worldwide trade network anchored by U.S. colonies and trading posts could provide the country with the economic growth it needed.
### Belief in Cultural Superiority
- Cultural factors also were used to justify imperialism. 
- The same xenophobia that helped pass the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, and led to its renewal in 1892 and 1902, fueled imperialist ideas about foreign nations. 
- Some Americans combined the philosophy of Social Darwinism—a belief that free-market competition would lead to the survival of the fittest—with a belief in the racial superiority of Anglo-Saxons. 
- They argued that the United States had a responsibility to spread Christianity and democracy to “civilize” the world's “inferior peoples.” 
- This viewpoint narrowly defined “civilization” according to the standards of only one culture.

## Alaska
- An early supporter of American expansion was William Seward, Secretary of State under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. 
- In 1867 Seward arranged for the United States to buy Alaska from the Russians for $7.2 million. 
- Seward had some trouble persuading the House of Representatives to approve funding for the purchase. 
- Some people thought it was silly to buy what they called “Seward's Icebox” or “Seward's folly.” 
- Time showed how wrong they were. 
- In 1959 Alaska became a state. 
- For about two cents an acre, the United States had acquired a land rich in timber, minerals, and, as it turned out, oil.
## Hawaii
- In 1867, the same year in which Alaska was purchased, the United States took over the Midway Islands, which lie in the Pacific Ocean about 1,300 miles north of Hawaii. 
- No one lived on the islands, so the event did not attract much attention. Hawaii was another question. 
- The Hawaiian Islands had been economically important to the United States for nearly a century. 
- Since the 1790s American merchants had stopped there on their way to China and East India. 
- In the 1820s Yankee missionaries founded Christian schools and churches on the islands. 
- Their children and grandchildren became sugar planters who sold most of their crop to the United States.
### The Cry for Annexation
- In the mid-19th century, American-owned sugar plantations accounted for about three-quarters of the Hawaii's wealth. 
- Plantation owners imported thousands of laborers from Japan, Portugal, and China. 
- By 1900 foreigners and immigrant laborers outnumbered native Hawaiians about three to one.
White planters profited from close ties with the United States. 
- In 1875 the United States agreed to import Hawaiian sugar duty-free. 
- Over the next 15 years, Hawaiian sugar production increased nine times. 
- Then the McKinley Tariff of 1890 provoked a crisis by eliminating the duty-free status of Hawaiian sugar. 
- As a result, Hawaiian sugar growers faced competition in the American market. 
- American planters in Hawaii called for the United States to annex the islands so they wouldn't have to pay the duty.
- U.S. military and economic leaders already understood the value of the islands. 
- In 1887 they pressured Hawaii to allow the United States to build a naval base at Pearl Harbor, the kingdom's best port. 
- The base became a coaling station for refueling American ships.
### The End of a Monarchy
- Also in that year, Hawaii's King Kalakaua had been strong-armed by white business leaders. 
- They forced him to amend Hawaii's constitution, effectively limiting voting rights to only wealthy landowners. 
- But when Kalakaua died in 1891, his sister Queen Liliuokalani came to power with a “Hawaii for Hawaiians” agenda. 
- She proposed removing the property-owning qualifications for voting. 
- To prevent this from happening, business groups—encouraged by Ambassador John L. Stevens—organized a revolution. 
- With the help of marines, they overthrew the queen and set up a government headed by Sanford B. Dole.
- President Cleveland directed that the queen be restored to her throne. 
- When Dole refused to surrender power, Cleveland formally recognized the Republic of Hawaii, but he refused to consider annexation unless a majority of Hawaiians favored it.
- In 1897 William McKinley, who favored annexation, succeeded Cleveland as president. 
- On August 12, 1898, Congress proclaimed Hawaii an American territory, although Hawaiians had never had the chance to vote. 
- In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th state of the United States.


# The Spanish-American War
## Cubans rebel against Spain
- By the end of the 19th century, Spain—once the most powerful colonial nation on earth—had lost most of its colonies. 
- It retained only the Philippines and the island of Guam in the Pacific, a few outposts in Africa, and the Caribbean islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Americas.
### American Interest in Cuba
- The United States had long held an interest in Cuba, which lies only 90 miles south of Florida. 
- In 1854 diplomats recommended to President Franklin Pierce that the United States buy Cuba from Spain. 
- The Spanish responded by saying that they would rather see Cuba sunk in the ocean.
But American interest in Cuba continued. 
- When the Cubans rebelled against Spain between 1868 and 1878, American sympathies went out to the Cuban people.
- The Cuban revolt against Spain was not successful, but in 1886 the Cuban people did force Spain to abolish slavery. 
- After the emancipation of Cuba’s slaves, American capitalists began investing millions of dollars in large sugar cane plantations on the island.
### The Second War for Independence
- Anti-Spanish sentiment in Cuba soon erupted into a second war for independence. 
- José Martí, a Cuban poet and journalist in exile in New York, launched a revolution in 1895. 
- Martí organized Cuban resistance against Spain, using an active guerrilla campaign and deliberately destroying property, especially American-owned sugar mills and plantations. 
- Martí counted on provoking U.S. intervention to help the rebels achieve ¡Cuba Libre!—a free Cuba. 
- Public opinion in the United States was split. 
- Many business people wanted the government to support Spain in order to protect their investments. 
- Other Americans, however, were enthusiastic about the rebel cause. 
- The cry “¡Cuba Libre!” was, after all, similar in sentiment to Patrick Henry’s “Give me liberty or give me death!” 
- Despite economic concerns and public opinion, President Grover Cleveland remained true to the Monroe Doctrine, which said that the United States would not intervene in the affairs of European colonies. 
- Soon, though, the promises of the Monroe Doctrine would be put to the test.
## War Fever Escalates
- In 1896 Spain responded to the Cuban revolt by sending General Valeriano Weyler to Cuba to restore order. 
- Weyler tried to crush the rebellion by herding the entire rural population of central and western Cuba into barbed-wire concentration camps. 
- Here, civilians could not give aid to rebels. 
- An estimated 300,000 Cubans filled these camps, where thousands died from hunger and disease.
### Headline Wars
- Weyler’s actions fueled a war over newspaper circulation that had developed between the American newspaper tycoons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer. 
- To lure readers, Hearst’s New York Journal and Pulitzer’s New York World printed exaggerated accounts—by reporters such as James Creelman—of “Butcher” Weyler’s brutality. 
- Stories of poisoned wells and of children being thrown to the sharks deepened American sympathy for the rebels. 
- This sensational style of writing, which exaggerates the news to lure and enrage readers, became known as yellow journalism. 
- Hearst and Pulitzer fanned war fever. 
- When Hearst sent the gifted artist Frederic Remington to Cuba to draw sketches of reporters’ stories, Remington informed the publisher that a war between the United States and Spain seemed very unlikely. 
- Hearst reportedly replied, “You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war.”
### The De Lome Letter
- American sympathy for “¡Cuba Libre!” grew with each day’s headlines. 
- When President William McKinley took office in 1897, demands for American intervention in Cuba were on the rise. 
- Preferring to avoid war with Spain, McKinley tried diplomatic means to resolve the crisis. 
- At first his efforts appeared to succeed. 
- Spain recalled General Weyler, modified the policy regarding concentration camps, and offered Cuba limited self-government. 
- In February 1898, however, the New York Journal published a private letter written by Enrique Dupuy de Lôme, the Spanish minister to the United States. 
- A Cuban rebel had stolen the letter from a Havana post office and leaked it to the newspaper, which was thirsty for scandal. 
- The de Lôme letter criticized President McKinley, calling him “weak” and “a bidder for the admiration of the crowd.” 
- The embarrassed Spanish government apologized, and the minister resigned. 
- Still, Americans were angry over the insult to their president.
### USS Maine explodes
- Only a few days after the publication of the de Lôme letter, American resentment toward Spain turned to outrage. 
- Early in 1898 President McKinley had ordered the USS Maine to Cuba to bring home American citizens in danger from the fighting and to protect American property. 
- On February 15, 1898, the ship blew up in the harbor of Havana. 
- More than 260 men were killed. 
- At the time, no one really knew why the ship exploded, however, American newspapers claimed that the Spanish had blown up the ship. 
- The Journal's headline read “The warship Maine was split in two by an enemy’s secret infernal machine.” 
- Hearst’s paper offered a reward of $50,000 for the capture of the Spaniards who supposedly had committed the outrage. 
- The de Lôme letter and the constant stream of sensational headlines helped feed a growing jingoism, or extreme patriotism. 
- When combined with the explosion of the Maine, these events had many Americans demanding war with Spain.

## War with spain erupts
- Until this time, the United States had remained largely isolationist, favoring a policy of avoiding foreign entanglements. 
- Now there was no holding back the forces that wanted war. 
- “Remember the Maine!” became the rallying cry for U.S. intervention in Cuba. 
- It made no difference that the Spanish government agreed, on April 9, to almost everything the United States demanded, including a six­-month cease­-fire.
- Despite the Spanish concessions, public opinion favored war. 
- On April 11 McKinley asked Congress for authority to use force against Spain. 
- After a week of debate, Congress agreed. 
- On April 20 the United States declared war.
### The war in the philipenes
- The Spanish thought the Americans would invade Cuba. 
- But the first battle of the war took place in a Spanish colony on the other side of the world—the Philippine Islands.
- On April 30 the American fleet in the Pacific steamed to the Philippines. 
- The next morning, Commodore George Dewey gave the command to open fire on the Spanish fleet at Manila, the Philippine capital. 
- Within hours, Dewey’s men had destroyed every Spanish ship there. 
- Dewey’s victory allowed U.S. troops to land in the Philippines.
- Dewey had the support of the Filipinos who, like the Cubans, also wanted freedom from Spain. 
- Over the next two months, 11,000 Americans joined forces with Filipino rebels led by Emilio Aguinaldo. 
- In August Spanish troops in Manila surrendered to the United States.
### The war in the caribbean
- In the Caribbean, hostilities began with a naval blockade of Cuba. 
- Admiral William T. 
- Sampson effectively sealed up the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba.
- Dewey’s victory at Manila had demonstrated the superiority of United States naval forces. 
- In contrast, the army maintained only a small professional force, supplemented by a larger, inexperienced, and ill-prepared volunteer force. 
- About 125,000 Americans had volunteered to fight. 
- The new soldiers were sent to training camps that lacked adequate supplies and effective leaders. 
- Moreover, there were not enough modern guns to go around, and the troops were outfitted with heavy woolen uniforms unsuitable for Cuba’s tropical climate. 
- In addition, the officers—most of whom were Civil War veterans—had a tendency to spend their time recalling their war experiences rather than training the volunteers.
### Rough Riders
- Despite these handicaps, American forces landed in Cuba in June 1898 and began to converge on the port city of Santiago. 
- The army of 17,000 included four African American regiments of the regular army and the Rough Riders, a volunteer cavalry under the command of Leonard Wood and Theodore Roosevelt. 
- Roosevelt, a New Yorker, had given up his job as assistant secretary of the navy to lead the group of volunteers. 
- He would later become president of the United States.
- The most famous land battle in Cuba took place near Santiago on July 1. 
- The first part of the battle, on nearby Kettle Hill, featured a dramatic uphill charge by the Rough Riders and two African American regiments, the Ninth and Tenth Cavalries. 
- Their victory cleared the way for an infantry attack on the strategically important San Juan Hill. 
- Although Roosevelt and his units played only a minor role in the second victory, U.S. newspapers declared him the hero of San Juan Hill.
- Two days later, the Spanish fleet tried to escape the American blockade of the harbor at Santiago. 
- The naval battle that followed, along the Cuban coast, ended in the destruction of the Spanish fleet. 
- On the heels of this victory, American troops invaded Puerto Rico on July 25.
### Treaty of paris
- The United States and Spain signed an armistice, a cease-fire agreement, on August 12, ending what Secretary of State John Hay called “a splendid little war.” 
- The actual fighting in the war had lasted only 15 weeks.
- On December 10, 1898, the United States and Spain met in Paris to agree on a treaty. 
- At the peace talks, Spain freed Cuba and turned over the islands of Guam in the Pacific and Puerto Rico in the West Indies to the United States. 
- Spain also sold the Philippines to the United States for $20 million.

### Debate over the treaty
- The Treaty of Paris touched off a great debate in the United States. 
- Arguments centered on whether or not the United States had the right to annex the Philippines, but imperialism was the real issue. 
- President McKinley told a group of Methodist ministers that he had prayed for guidance on Philippine annexation and had concluded “that there was nothing left for us to do but to take them all [the Philippine Islands], and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and Christianize them.” 
- McKinley's need to justify imperialism may have clouded his memory—most Filipinos had been Christian for centuries. 
- Other prominent Americans presented a variety of arguments—political, moral, and economic—against annexation. 
- Some felt that the treaty violated the Declaration of Independence by denying self-government to the newly acquired territories. 
- The African American educator Booker T. Washington argued that the United States should settle race-related issues at home before taking on social problems elsewhere. 
- The labor leader Samuel Gompers feared that Filipino immigrants would compete for American jobs.
- On February 6, 1899, the annexation question was settled with the Senate’s approval of the Treaty of Paris. 
- The United States now had an empire that included Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. 
- The next question Americans faced was how and when the United States would add to its dominion.


# Acquiring new lands
## Ruling Puerto Rico
- Some Puerto Ricans wanted independence
- Others wanted statehood or territory
### Military Rule
- During the Spanish-American war, General Nelson Miles, took over the island
- For the time being, Puerto Rico would be controlled by the military until Congress decided otherwise.
### Return to Civil Government
- Many Puerto Ricans wanted independence or statehood
- The U.S. just wanted it because it protected Panama Canal
- In 1900 Congress passed the Foraker Act, which ended military rule in Puerto Rico and set up a civil government.
- The act gave the president of the United States the power to appoint Puerto Rico’s governor and members of the upper house of its legislature.
- In the Insular Cases, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution did not apply to people in territories. 
- Congress granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans in 1917. 
- It also gave them the right to elect both houses of their legislature.

## Cuba and the United States
- When the United States declared war against Spain in 1898, it recognized Cuba’s independence from Spain. 
- It also passed the Teller Amendment, which said that the United States had no intention of taking over any part of Cuba. 
- The Treaty of Paris, which ended the war, further guaranteed Cuba the independence that its nationalist leaders had been demanding for years.
### American Soldiers
- Though officially independent, Cuba was occupied by American troops when the war ended. 
- José Martí, the Cuban patriot who had led the movement for independence from Spain, had feared that the United States would merely replace Spain and dominate Cuban politics. 
- In some ways, Martí’s prediction came true. 
- Under American occupation, the same officials who had served Spain remained in office. 
- Cubans who protested this policy were imprisoned or exiled.
On the other hand, the American military government provided food and clothing for thousands of families, helped farmers put land back into cultivation, and organized elementary schools. 
- Through improvement of sanitation and medical research, the military government helped eliminate yellow fever, a disease that had killed hundreds of Cubans each year.
### Platt Amendment
- In 1900 the newly formed Cuban government wrote a constitution for an independent Cuba. 
- The constitution, however, did not specify the relationship between Cuba and the United States. 
- Consequently, in 1901 the United States insisted that Cuba add to its constitution several provisions, known as the Platt Amendment
- The United States made it clear that its army would not withdraw until Cuba adopted the Platt Amendment. 
- In response, a torchlight procession marched on the residence of Governor-General Leonard Wood in protest. 
- Some protestors even called for a return to arms to defend their national honor against this American insult. 
- The U.S. government stood firm, though, and Cubans reluctantly ratified the new constitution. 
- In 1903 the Platt Amendment became part of a treaty between the two nations, and it remained in effect for 31 years. 
- Under the terms of the treaty, Cuba became a U.S. protectorate, a country whose affairs are partially controlled by a stronger power.
- Contents: 
    - Cuba could not make treaties that might limit its independence or permit a foreign power to control any part of its territory
    - Cuba could not make treaties that might limit its independence or permit a foreign power to control any part of its territory
    - Cuba was not to go into debt that its government could not repay
    - the United States could buy or lease land on the island for naval stations and refueling stations
### Protecting American Business Interests
- The most important reason for the United States to maintain a strong political presence in Cuba was to protect American businesses. 
- U.S. companies had invested in the island’s sugar, tobacco, and mining industries, as well as in its railroads and public utilities.
- Although many businesspeople were convinced that annexing and imposing colonial rule on new territories was necessary to protect American business interests, some were concerned about colonial entanglements. 
- The industrialist Andrew Carnegie voiced his opposition to the taking of nations as colonies. 
- Despite such concerns, the U.S. State Department continued to push for control of its Latin American neighbors. 
- In the years to come, the United States would intervene time and again in the affairs of other nations in the Western Hemisphere.


## Filipinos Rebel
- In the Philippines, Filipinos reacted with outrage to the Treaty of Paris, which called for American annexation of the Philippines. The rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo believed that the United States had promised independence. When he and his followers learned the terms of the treaty, they vowed to fight for freedom.
### Philippine-American War
- In February 1899 the Filipinos, led by Aguinaldo, rose in revolt. 
- The United States assumed almost the same role that Spain had played, imposing its authority on a colony that was fighting for freedom. 
- When Aguinaldo turned to guerrilla tactics, the United States forced Filipinos to live in designated zones, where poor sanitation, starvation, and disease killed thousands. 
- This was the very same practice that Americans had condemned Spain for using in Cuba.
- During the occupation, white American soldiers looked on the Filipinos as inferiors. 
- Many of the 70,000 U.S. troops sent to the Philippines were African Americans. 
- When African American newspapers questioned why blacks were helping to spread racial prejudice to the Philippines, some African American soldiers deserted to the Filipino side.
- It took the Americans nearly three years to put down the rebellion. 
- About 20,000 Filipino rebels died fighting for independence. 
- The war claimed 4,000 American lives and cost $400 million—20 times the price the United States had paid to purchase the islands.
### Aftermath
- After suppressing the rebellion, the United States set up a government similar to the one it had established for Puerto Rico. 
- The U.S. president would appoint a governor, who would then appoint the upper house of the legislature. 
- Filipinos would elect the lower house of the legislature. 
- Under American rule, the island nation moved gradually toward independence. 
- On July 4, 1946, the Philippines became an independent republic.
## Foreign Infuence in China
- U.S. imperialists saw the Philippines as a gateway to the rest of Asia, particularly to China. 
- China was seen as a vast potential market for American products. 
- It also presented American investors with new opportunities for large-scale railroad construction.
- Weakened by war and foreign intervention, China had become known as the “sick man of Asia.” 
- France, Germany, Britain, Japan, and Russia had established prosperous settlements along the coast of China. 
- They also had carved out spheres of influence, areas where each nation claimed special rights and economic privileges.
### John Hay's open door notes
- The United States began to fear that the other foreign powers would carve China into colonies and American traders would be shut out. 
- To protect American interests, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay issued a series of policy statements called the Open Door notes. 
- The notes were letters addressed to the leaders of Germany, Russia, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan proposing that the nations share their trading rights with the United States. 
- This would create an open door policy, meaning that no single nation would have a monopoly on trade with any part of China. 
- The other imperialist powers reluctantly accepted this policy.
### Boxer rebellion
- Although China kept its freedom, Europeans dominated most of China’s large cities. 
- Resentment simmered beneath the surface as some Chinese formed secret societies pledged to rid the country of “foreign devils.” 
- The most famous of these secret groups were the Boxers, so named by Westerners because members practiced martial arts.
- The Boxers killed hundreds of missionaries and other foreigners, as well as Chinese converts to Christianity. 
- Foreign citizens fled to Beijing to escape the Boxer onslaught. 
- In August 1900 troops from Britain, France, Germany, and Japan joined about 2,500 American soldiers and marched on the Chinese capital. 
- As the foreign armies took back territory, they pushed to secure their spheres of influence within China. 
- Within two months, the international forces put down the Boxer Rebellion. 
- Thousands of Chinese people died during the fighting.
- On September 7, 1901, China and 11 other nations signed the Boxer Protocol—a final settlement of the Boxer Rebellion. 
- The Qing government agreed to execute some Chinese officials, to punish others, and to pay about $332 million in damages. 
- The United States was awarded a settlement of $24.5 million. 
- It used about $4 million to pay American citizens for actual losses incurred during the rebellion. 
- In 1908 the U.S. government returned the rest of the money to China to be used for the purpose of educating Chinese students in their own country and in the United States.
### Protecting American Rights
- After the Boxer Rebellion, the United States feared that European nations would use their victory to take even greater control of China. 
- To prevent this, John Hay issued a second series of Open Door notes, announcing that the United States would “safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire.” 
- This policy paved the way for greater American influence in Asia.
- The Open Door policy reflected three deeply held American beliefs about the United States industrial capitalist economy. 
- 1. First, Americans believed that the growth of the U.S. economy depended on exports. 
- 2.  Second, they felt the United States had a right to intervene abroad to keep foreign markets open. 
- 3. Third, they feared that the closing of an area to American products, citizens, or ideas threatened U.S. survival. 
- These beliefs became the bedrock of American foreign policy.

## Impact of U.S. Territorial Gains
- In 1900 Republican William McKinley, a reluctant but confirmed imperialist, was elected to a second term against Democrat William Jennings Bryan, who staunchly opposed imperialism. 
- McKinley’s reelection confirmed that a majority of Americans favored his policies. 
- Under McKinley, the United States had gained an empire.
- Yet before McKinley was reelected, an Anti-Imperialist League had sprung into being. 
- The league included some of the most prominent people in America, such as former president Grover Cleveland, industrial leader Andrew Carnegie, labor leader Samuel Gompers, social worker Jane Addams, and many leading writers. 
- Anti-imperialists had different and sometimes conflicting reasons for their opposition. 
- For example, Gompers was concerned about the impact of imperialism on U.S. workers. 
- Carnegie, on the other hand, worried that U.S. imperialism could lead to endless wars with European rivals. 
- All anti-imperialists, though, agreed that it was wrong for the United States to rule other people without their consent. 
- These beliefs were summed up by the vice-president of the New England Anti-Imperialist League, Moorfield Storey.
- People really didn't listen to them.


# America as a world power
## Teddy Roosevelt and the World
- The assassination of William McKinley in 1901 thrust Vice-President Theodore Roosevelt into the role of a world leader. 
- Roosevelt was unwilling to allow the imperial powers of Europe to control the world’s political and economic destiny. 
- In 1905, building on the Open Door notes to increase American influence in East Asia, Roosevelt mediated a settlement in a war between Russia and Japan.
### Roosevelt the Peacemaker
- In 1904 Russia and Japan, Russia’s neighbor in East Asia, were both imperialist powers, and they were competing for control of Korea. 
- The Japanese took the first action in what would become the Russo-Japanese War with a sudden attack on the Russian Pacific fleet. 
- To everyone’s surprise, Japan destroyed it. 
- Japan then proceeded to destroy a second fleet sent as reinforcement. 
- Japan also won a series of land battles, securing Korea and Manchuria.
- As a result of these battles, Japan began to run out of men and money, a fact that it did not want to reveal to Russia. 
- Instead, Japanese officials approached President Roosevelt in secret and asked him to mediate peace negotiations. 
- Roosevelt agreed, and in 1905 Russian and Japanese delegates convened in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
- The first meeting took place on the presidential yacht. 
- Roosevelt had a charming way of greeting people with a grasp of the hand, a broad grin, and a hearty “Dee-lighted.” 
- Soon the opposing delegates began to relax and cordially shook hands.
- The Japanese wanted Sakhalin Island, off the coast of Siberia, and a large sum of money from Russia. 
- Russia refused. 
- Roosevelt persuaded Japan to accept half the island and forgo the cash payment. 
- In exchange, Russia agreed to let Japan take over Russian interests in Manchuria and Korea. 
- The successful efforts in negotiating the Treaty of Portsmouth won Roosevelt the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize.
- As U.S. and Japanese interests expanded in East Asia, the two nations continued diplomatic talks. 
- In later agreements, they pledged to respect each other’s possessions and interests in East Asia and the Pacific.
### Panama Canal
- By the time Roosevelt became president, many Americans, including Roosevelt, felt that the United States needed a canal cutting across Central America. 
- Such a canal would greatly reduce travel time for commercial and military ships by providing a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 
- As early as 1850 the United States and Britain had agreed to share the rights to such a canal. 
- In the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of 1901, however, Britain gave the United States exclusive rights to build and control a canal through Central America.
- Engineers identified two possible routes for the proposed canal. 
- One, through Nicaragua, posed fewer obstacles because much of it crossed a large lake. 
- The other route crossed through Panama (then a province of Colombia) and was shorter and filled with mountains and swamps. 
- In the late 1800s a French company had tried to build a canal in Panama. After ten years, the company gave up. 
- It sent an agent, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, to Washington to convince the United States to buy its claim. 
- In 1903 the president and Congress decided to use the Panama route and agreed to buy the French company’s route for $40 million.
- Before beginning work on the Panama Canal, the United States had to get permission from Colombia, which then ruled Panama. 
- When these negotiations broke down, Bunau-Varilla helped organize a Panamanian rebellion against Colombia. 
- Aided by a U.S. naval blockade that stopped Colombian troops from landing in Panama, the rebels won independence. 
- On November 3, 1903, nearly a dozen U.S. Navy warships were present as Panama declared its independence from Colombia.
- This threat of military force by the United States was a prime example of gunboat diplomacy. 
- Fifteen days later, Panama and the United States signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty. 
- The United States agreed to pay Panama $10 million plus an annual rent of $250,000 for an area of land across Panama, called the Canal Zone. 
- The United States now controlled the canal route across the Isthmus of Panama and could begin construction on the Panama Canal.
### Constructing the Canal
- Construction of the Panama Canal ranks as one of the world’s greatest engineering feats. 
- Builders fought diseases, such as yellow fever and malaria, and soft volcanic soil, that proved difficult to remove from where it lay. 
- Work began in 1904 with the clearing of brush and draining of swamps. 
- By 1913, the height of the construction, more than 43,400 workers were employed. 
- Some had come from Italy and Spain; three-quarters were blacks from the British West Indies. 
- More than 5,600 workers on the canal died from accidents or disease. 
- The total cost to the United States was about $380 million.
- On August 15, 1914, the canal opened for business, and more than 1,000 merchant ships passed through during its first year. 
- U.S.-Latin American relations, however, had been damaged by American support of the rebellion in Panama. 
- The resulting ill will lasted for decades, despite Congress’s paying Colombia $25 million in 1921 to compensate the country for its lost territory.
### The Roosevelt Corollary
- Financial factors drew the United States further into Latin American affairs. 
- In the late 19th century, many Latin American nations had borrowed huge sums from European banks to build railroads and develop industries. 
- Roosevelt feared that if these nations defaulted on their loans, Europeans might intervene. 
- He was determined to make the United States the predominant power in the Caribbean and Central America.
- Roosevelt reminded the European powers of the Monroe Doctrine, which had been issued in 1823 by President James Monroe. 
- The Monroe Doctrine demanded that European countries stay out of the affairs of Latin American nations. 
- Roosevelt based his Latin America policy on a West African proverb that said, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” 
- In his December 1904 message to Congress, Roosevelt added the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. 
- He warned that disorder in Latin America might “force the United States...to the exercise of an international police power.” 
- In effect, the corollary said that the United States would now use force to protect its economic interests in Latin America.
### Dollar Diplomacy
- During the next decade, the United States exercised its police power on several occasions. 
- For example, when a 1911 rebellion in Nicaragua left the nation near bankruptcy, President William H. Taft, Roosevelt’s successor, arranged for American bankers to loan Nicaragua enough money to pay its debts.
- In return, the bankers were given the right to recover their money by collecting Nicaragua’s customs duties. 
- The U.S. bankers also gained control of Nicaragua’s state-owned railroad system and its national bank. 
- When Nicaraguan citizens heard about this deal, they revolted against President Adolfo Díaz. 
- To prop up Díaz's government, some 2,000 marines were sent to Nicaragua. 
- The revolt was put down, but some marine detachments remained in the country until 1933.
- The Taft administration followed the policy of using the U.S. government to guarantee loans made to foreign countries by American businesspeople. 
- This policy was called dollar diplomacy by its critics and was often used to justify keeping European powers out of the Caribbean.
## Woodrow Wilson's Missionary Diplomacy
- The Monroe Doctrine, issued by President James Monroe in 1823, had warned other nations against expanding their influence in Latin America. 
- The Roosevelt Corollary asserted, in 1904, that the United States had a right to exercise international police power in the Western Hemisphere. 
- In 1913 President Woodrow Wilson gave the Monroe Doctrine a moral tone.
- According to Wilson’s “missionary diplomacy,” the United States had a moral responsibility to deny recognition to any Latin American government it viewed as oppressive, undemocratic, or hostile to U.S. interests. 
- Prior to this policy, the United States recognized any government that controlled a nation, regardless of that nation’s policies or how it had come to power. 
- Wilson’s policy pressured nations in the Western Hemisphere to establish democratic governments. 
- Almost immediately, the Mexican Revolution put Wilson’s policy to the test.
### Mexican Revolution
- Mexico had been ruled for more than three decades by a military dictator, Porfirio Díaz. 
- A friend of the United States, Díaz had long encouraged foreign investments in his country. 
- As a result, foreigners, mostly Americans, owned a large share of Mexican oil wells, mines, railroads, and ranches. 
- While foreign investors and some Mexican landowners and politicians had grown rich, the common people of the country were desperately poor.
- In 1911 Mexican peasants and workers led by Francisco Madero overthrew Díaz. Later that year Madero was elected president. 
- He promised democratic reforms, but he proved unable to satisfy the conflicting demands of landowners, peasants, factory workers, and the urban middle class. 
- After two years, General Victoriano Huerta took over the government. Within days, Madero was murdered. 
- Wilson refused to recognize the government that Huerta formed. 
- He called it “a government of butchers.”
### Intervention in Mexico
- Wilson adopted a plan of “watchful waiting,” looking for an opportunity to act against Huerta. 
- The opportunity came in April 1914, when one of Huerta’s officers arrested a small group of American sailors in Tampico, on Mexico’s eastern shore. 
- The Mexicans quickly released them and apologized, but Wilson used the incident as an excuse to intervene in Mexico and ordered U.S. Marines to occupy Veracruz, an important Mexican port. 
- Eighteen Americans and at least 200 Mexicans died during the invasion.
- The incident brought the United States and Mexico close to war. 
- The three most powerful countries in Latin America, known as the ABC powers—Argentina, Brazil, and Chile—stepped in to mediate the conflict. 
- At the ABC Conference in Niagara Falls, New York, they proposed that Huerta step down and that U.S. troops withdraw without paying Mexico for damages. 
- Mexico rejected the plan, and Wilson refused to recognize a government that had come to power as a result of violence. 
- The Huerta regime soon collapsed, however, and Venustiano Carranza, a nationalist leader, became president in 1915. 
- Wilson withdrew the troops and formally recognized the Carranza government.
### Rebellion in Mexico
- Carranza was in charge, but like others before him, he did not have the support of all Mexicans. 
- Rebels under the leadership of Francisco “Pancho” Villa and Emiliano Zapata opposed Carranza’s provisional government. 
- Zapata—son of a mestizo peasant—was dedicated to land reform. 
- “It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees,” Zapata told the peasants who joined him.
- Villa, a fierce nationalist, had frequently courted the support and aid of the United States. 
- Despite Villa’s talk of friendship, when President Wilson recognized Carranza’s government, Villa threatened reprisals against the United States. 
- In January 1916 Carranza invited American engineers to operate mines in northern Mexico. 
- Before they reached the mines, however, Villa’s men took the Americans off a train and shot them. 
- Two months later, some of Villa’s followers raided Columbus, New Mexico, and killed 17 Americans. 
- Americans held Villa responsible.
### Chasing Villa
- With the American public demanding revenge, President Wilson ordered Brigadier General John J. Pershing and an expeditionary force of about 15,000 soldiers into Mexico to capture Villa dead or alive. 
- For almost a year, Villa eluded Pershing’s forces. 
- Wilson then called out 150,000 National Guardsmen and stationed them along the Mexican border. 
- In the meantime, Mexicans grew angrier over the U.S. invasion of their land. 
- In June 1916 U.S. troops clashed with Carranza’s army, resulting in deaths on both sides.
- Carranza demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops, but Wilson refused. 
- War seemed imminent. 
- However, in the end, both sides backed down. 
- The United States, facing war in Europe, needed peace on its southern border. 
- In February 1917 Wilson ordered Pershing to return home. 
- Later that year, Mexico adopted a constitution that gave the government control of the nation’s oil and mineral resources and placed strict regulations on foreign investors.
- Although Carranza had called for the constitution of 1917, he failed to carry out its measures. 
- Instead, he ruled oppressively until 1920, when a moderate named Alvaro Obregón came to power. 
- Obregón’s presidency marked the end of civil war and the beginning of reform.
- U.S. intervention in Mexican affairs provided a clear model of American imperialist attitudes in the early years of the 20th century. 
- Americans believed in the superiority of free-enterprise democracy, and the American government attempted to extend the reach of this economic and political system, even through armed intervention.
- The United States pursued and achieved several foreign policy goals in the early 20th century. 
- 1. First, it expanded U.S. access to foreign markets in order to ensure the continued growth of the domestic economy. 
- 2. Second, the United States built a modern navy to protect its interests abroad. 
- 3. Third, the United States exercised its international police power to ensure dominance in Latin America.
