# Lesson 2
## Rapid growth of cities forced people to deal with problems of housing, transportation, water and sanitation
## In comparison, people now have better living conditions

### A combination of technological advancements and hard times in europe made Urbanization possible
- Making a living in the late 19th and 20th centuries was not easy
- There were natural and economic disasters in Europe
- This caused alot of people to come to the US, very fast
- from 1870 to 1920, population went from 10 mill to 54 mill
- The rapid growth of technology, also helped with the rapid urbanization
- **Urbanization - growth of cities**
- Urbanization made spaces overcrowded and resources scarce

### There were lots of problems with rapid Urbanization
- Housing was a big problem
- People were forced to cram into crappy apartments called tenements
- Jacob Riis a Muckraker helped point this out
- **Muckraker - investigative journalist**
- Cities also had to supply saf drinking water for people
- A lot of people had no piped water
- They had to collect water in pails
- Chlorination was introsduced, but the majority of people didn't have clean water

### The americanization movement was made to help immigrants from other countries learn the american way of life
- The Americanization movement was designed to assimilate people of wide-ranging cultures into the dominant culture. 
- This helped immigrants get comfortable with American culture.
- A big example of this is Ford motor teaching its employees english for free

# Lesson 3
## Local and national political corruption in the 19th century led to calls for reform.
## Political reforms paved the way for a more honest and efficient government in the 20th century and beyond.
### Social Darwinism
- In the late 19th century, cities experienced rapid growth under inefficient government. In a climate influenced by dog-eat-dog 
- **Social Darwinism - which means that only the strongest survive**

### Political Machines
- **Political Machines - groups that controlled the activities of political parties**
- The machine was organized like a pyramid. 
- At the pyramid’s base were local precinct workers and captains who reported to a ward boss. 
- They tried to get voters’ support on a city block or in a neighborhood. 
- At election time, the ward boss worked to secure the vote in all the precincts in the ward, or electoral district. 
- Ward bosses helped the poor and gained their votes by doing favors or providing services.

### Abuse of the system
- When the loyalty of voters was not enough to carry an election, some political machines turned to fraud.
- Party members used fake names to get as many votes as possible. 
- Once a political machine got its candidates into office, it could take advantage of numerous opportunities for graft
- **graft - political gain for personal use.**

# Lesson 4
## Advances in science and technology helped solve urban problems, including overcrowding.
## American cities continue to depend on the results of scientific and technological research.

### Skyscrapers
- In 1890–1891, Louis Sullivan made the ten-story Wainwright Building in St. Louis. 
- He called the new breed of skyscraper a “proud and soaring thing.” 
- Architects could make larger buildings because:
  - The development of internal steel skeletons to bear the weight.
  - The invention of elevators
- People ran out of space to expand horizontally
- Instead of spreading out, they began to build up.
- The skyscraper became America's greatest contribution to architecture
### Electric Transit
- As skyscrapers expanded upward, changes in transportation allowed cities to spread outward.
- In 1888 Richmond, Virginia, became the first American city to electrify its urban transit.
- New railroad lines also fed the growth of suburbs, allowing residents to commute to downtown jobs.
- New York’s northern suburbs alone moved 100,000 commuters each day to the central business district.
- A few large cities moved their streetcars far above street level, creating elevated or “el” trains. 
- Other cities, like New York, did the exact opposite, and built subways by moving their rail lines underground. 
### Engineering and Urban Planning
- Steel-cable suspension bridges, like the Brooklyn Bridge, also brought cities’ sections closer together. 
- City planners tried to restore serenity to the environment by designing recreational areas.
- Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted led the movement for planned urban parks.
- Central Park
  - In 1857 Olmsted, along with English-born architect Calvert Vaux, helped draw up a plan for “Greensward.”
  - This eventually became central park, in New York
  - Olmsted envisioned the park as a rustic haven in the center of the busy city. 
- In the 1870s Olmsted planned landscaping for Washington, DC, and St. Louis.
- He also drew the initial designs for “the Emerald Necklace,” Boston’s parks system.
### City Planning
- By contrast, Chicago, with its explosive growth from 30,000 people in 1850 to 300,000 in 1870, represented uncontrolled expansion. 
- Fortunately for the city, a local architect, Daniel Burnham, was intrigued by the prospect of remaking the city. 
- His motto was “Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men’s blood.” 
### Feeding Cities
- To feed their populations, large cities needed a reliable food supply.
- New technologies and ideas allowed farmers to produce more crops on the same amount of land with fewer workers.
- The ideas of George Washington Carver helped revolutionize farming in the South.
  - Carver promoted the idea of crop rotation.
  - **Crop rotation - a method for restoring nitrogen, an important nutrient for growing crops, to the soil**
  - Carver even developed and promoted ways to use crops that restored soil nutrients, such as peanuts. 
  - By promoting new uses for these crops, Carver provided farmers with new markets.
- Another important breakthrough in agriculture occurred in 1905.
  - Chemist Fritz Haber discovered a way to extract nitrogen from the air.
  - This discovery led to the Haber-Bosch process, which made it possible to create chemical fertilizers.
  - With chemical fertilizers, farmers could provide nutrients directly to crops. 
  -  By 1909 farmers were using more than 3 million tons of chemical fertilizer a year.
- Even though farmers could produce plenty of food for the growing population, they still needed a way to get their products to market before they spoiled.
- One solution was refrigerated railroad cars. 
- Another was chemical preservatives, such as borax. 
- These chemicals did extend the freshness of food, but many were harmful to human health. 
- By 1906 the government would enact regulations to ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply.
### A Revolution in Printing
- American mills began to produce huge quantities of cheap paper from wood pulp.
- The new paper proved durable enough to withstand high-speed presses.
- Faster production and lower costs made newspapers and magazines more affordable. 
### Airplanes
- In the early 20th century,Orville and Wilbur Wright, experimented with new engines powerful enough to keep “heavier-than-air” craft aloft.
- Within two years, the Wright brothers had increased their flights to 24 miles. 
- By 1920, convinced of the great potential of flight, the U.S. government had established the first transcontinental airmail service.
### Photography Explosion
- Before the 1880s, photography was a professional activity. 
- Because of the time required to take a picture and the weight of the equipment, a photographer could not shoot a moving object.
- George Eastman developed a series of more convenient alternatives to the heavy glass plates previously used. 
- Now, instead of carrying their darkrooms around with them, photographers could use flexible film, coated with gelatin emulsions, and could send their film to a studio for processing. 
- When professional photographers were slow to begin using the new film, Eastman decided to aim his product at the masses.
- Kodak
  - In 1888 Eastman introduced his Kodak camera. 
  - The purchase price of $25 included a 100-picture roll of film. 
  - After taking the pictures, the photographer would send the camera back to Eastman’s Rochester factory. 
  - For $10, the pictures were developed and returned with the camera reloaded. 

# Lesson 5
## As Americans had more time for leisure activities, a modern mass culture emerged.
## Today the United States has a worldwide impact on mass culture.
- As the 19th century drew to a close, many Americans could forget city congestion and dull industrial work with leisure time.
### Amusement Parks
- Cities worked to meet the recreational needs of their residents.
- Many built amusement parks for their citizens
- Some amusement parks were constructed on the outskirts of cities. 
- Often trolley-car companies built them to attract more passengers.
- The roller coaster drew adventurous customers to Coney Island in 1884.
### Bicycling
- Bicycling was initially very hard to do because of the way the wheels were
- However, in 1885 the first commercially successful “safety bicycle” was built.
- This made a sudden boom in bicycling
- Susan B. Anthony declared, “I think bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. . . . It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance.” 
### Tennis
- The modern version of this sport originated in North Wales in 1873. 
- A year later, the US, saw its first tennis match
### Baseball
- New rules changed baseball into a professional sport. 
- In 1869 a professional team named the Cincinnati Red Stockings toured the country. 
- This led to the formation of the National League in 1876 and the American League in 1900.
- African American baseball players were excluded from both leagues because of racial discrimination.
