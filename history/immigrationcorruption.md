# Lesson 2
## Rapid growth of cities forced people to deal with problems of housing, transportation, water and sanitation
## In comparison, people now have better living conditions

### A combination of technological advancements and hard times in europe made Urbanization possible
- Making a living in the late 19th and 20th centuries was not easy
- There were natural and economic disasters in Europe
- This caused alot of people to come to the US, very fast
- from 1870 to 1920, population went from 10 mill to 54 mill
- The rapid growth of technology, also helped with the rapid urbanization
- **Urbanization - growth of cities**
- Urbanization made spaces overcrowded and resources scarce

### There were lots of problems with rapid Urbanization
- Housing was a big problem
- People were forced to cram into crappy apartments called tenements
- Jacob Riis a Muckraker helped point this out
- **Muckraker - investigative journalist**
- Cities also had to supply saf drinking water for people
- A lot of people had no piped water
- They had to collect water in pails
- Chlorination was introsduced, but the majority of people didn't have clean water

### The americanization movement was made to help immigrants from other countries learn the american way of life
- The Americanization movement was designed to assimilate people of wide-ranging cultures into the dominant culture. 
- This helped immigrants get comfortable with American culture.
- A big example of this is Ford motor teaching its employees english for free

# Lesson 3
## Local and national political corruption in the 19th century led to calls for reform.
## Political reforms paved the way for a more honest and efficient government in the 20th century and beyond.
### Social Darwinism
- In the late 19th century, cities experienced rapid growth under inefficient government. In a climate influenced by dog-eat-dog 
- **Social Darwinism - which means that only the strongest survive**

### Political Machines
- **Political Machines - groups that controlled the activities of political parties**
- The machine was organized like a pyramid. 
- At the pyramid’s base were local precinct workers and captains who reported to a ward boss. 
- They tried to get voters’ support on a city block or in a neighborhood. 
- At election time, the ward boss worked to secure the vote in all the precincts in the ward, or electoral district. 
- Ward bosses helped the poor and gained their votes by doing favors or providing services.

### Abuse of the system
- When the loyalty of voters was not enough to carry an election, some political machines turned to fraud.
- Party members used fake names to get as many votes as possible. 
- Once a political machine got its candidates into office, it could take advantage of numerous opportunities for graft
- **graft - political gain for personal use.**

# Lesson 4
## Advances in science and technology helped solve urban problems, including overcrowding.
## American cities continue to depend on the results of scientific and technological research.

### Skyscrapers
- Architects could make larger buildings because:
  - The development of internal steel skeletons to bear the weight.
  - The invention of elevators
