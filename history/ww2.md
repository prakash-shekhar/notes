# War Breaks Out
## Failures of the Treaty of Versailles
The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, left many European nations dissatisfied. The treaty’s war-guilt clause placed the blame for the war solely on Germany. The treaty also demanded that the Germans pay reparations, or payments for damages and expenses caused by the war. The amount demanded far exceeded what the German government could actually afford to pay. Instead of securing a “just and secure peace,” the Treaty of Versailles caused anger and resentment. Germans saw nothing fair in a treaty that blamed them for starting the war. Nor did they find security in a settlement that stripped them of their overseas colonies and border territories. The terms of the treaty did serious damage to the German economy. It forced Germany to give up control of some of its major industrial regions, which made the reparations payments even more challenging. These factors helped bring about a period of severe inflation, or rising prices. Prices increased at such an incredible rate that by 1923, German currency had simply ceased to have any meaningful value. These problems overwhelmed the Weimar Republic, the democratic government set up in Germany after World War I. Italy was also unhappy with the treaty. The Italians had been on the winning side in the war. They had hoped to be rewarded with territory as part of the treaty. Instead, they were largely ignored during the peace talks. Similarly dissatisfied, the Soviets resented the carving up of parts of Russia. The peace settlement had not fulfilled President Wilson’s hope of a world “safe for democracy.” New democratic governments that emerged in Europe after the war floundered. Without a democratic tradition, people turned to authoritarian leaders to solve their economic and social problems. The new democracies collapsed, and dictators were able to seize power. Some had great ambitions.
## The Spread of Totalitarianism
The seeds of new conflicts had been sown in World War I. For many nations, peace had brought not prosperity but revolution fueled by economic depression and struggle. The postwar years also brought the rise of powerful dictators driven by the belief in nationalism—loyalty to one’s country above all else—and dreams of territorial expansion.
### JOSEPH STALIN TRANSFORMS THE SOVIET UNION
In Russia, hopes for democracy gave way to civil war, resulting in the establishment of a Communist state, officially called the Soviet Union, in 1922. After V. I. Lenin died in 1924, Joseph Stalin, whose last name means “man of steel,” took control of the country. Stalin focused on creating a model Communist state. In doing so, he made both agricultural and industrial growth the prime economic goals of the Soviet Union. Stalin abolished all privately owned farms and replaced them with collectives—large governmentowned farms, each worked by hundreds of families. Stalin moved to transform the Soviet Union from a backward rural nation into a great industrial power. In 1928 the Soviet dictator outlined the first of several “five-year plans” for industrialization. All economic activity was placed under state management. By 1937 the Soviet Union had become the world’s second-largest industrial power, surpassed in overall production only by the United States. The human costs of this transformation were enormous. In his drive to purge, or eliminate, anyone who threatened his power, Stalin did not spare even his most faithful supporters. While the final toll will never be known, historians estimate that Stalin was responsible for the deaths of 8 million to 13 million people. Millions more died in famines caused by the restructuring of Soviet society. By 1939 Stalin had firmly established a totalitarian government that tried to exert complete control over its citizens. In a totalitarian state, individuals have no rights, and the government suppresses all opposition.
### THE RISE OF FASCISM IN ITALY 
While Stalin was consolidating his power in the Soviet Union, Benito Mussolini was establishing a totalitarian regime in Italy, where unemployment and inflation produced bitter strikes. Some of those strikes were led by Communists. Alarmed by these threats, the middle and upper classes demanded stronger leadership. Mussolini took advantage of this situation. A powerful speaker, Mussolini knew how to appeal to Italy’s wounded national pride. He played on the fears of economic collapse and communism. “Italy wants peace, work, and calm. I will give these things with love if possible, with force if necessary,” he said. In this way, he won the support of many discontented Italians. By 1921 Mussolini had established the Fascist Party. Fascism (făshʹĭz´әm) stressed nationalism and placed the interests of the state above those of individuals. To strengthen the nation, Fascists argued, power must rest with a single strong leader and a small group of devoted party members. (The Latin fasces—a bundle of rods tied around an ax handle—had been a symbol of unity and authority in ancient Rome.) In October 1922 Mussolini marched on Rome with thousands of his followers, whose black uniforms gave them the name “Black Shirts.” When important government officials, the army, and the police sided with the Fascists, the Italian king appointed Mussolini head of the government. Calling himself Il Duce, or “the leader,” Mussolini gradually extended Fascist control to every aspect of Italian life. Tourists marveled that Il Duce had even “made the trains run on time.” Mussolini achieved this efficiency, however, by crushing all opposition and by making Italy a totalitarian state.
### THE NAZIS TAKE OVER GERMANY 
In Germany, Adolf Hitler had followed a path to power similar to Mussolini’s. At the end of World War I, Hitler had been a jobless soldier drifting around Germany. In 1919 he joined a struggling group called the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, better known as the Nazi Party. Despite its name, this party had no ties to socialism. Hitler proved to be such a powerful public speaker and organizer that he quickly became the party’s leader. Calling himself Der Führer—“the Leader”—he promised to bring Germany out of chaos. In his book Mein Kampf [My Struggle], Hitler set forth the basic beliefs of Nazism that became the plan of action for the Nazi Party. Nazism (nätʹsĭz´әm), the German brand of fascism, was based on extreme nationalism. Hitler, who had been born in Austria, dreamed of uniting all Germanspeaking people in a great German empire. Hitler also wanted to enforce racial “purification” at home. In his view, Germans—especially blue-eyed, blond-haired “Aryans”—formed a “master race” that was destined to rule the world. “Inferior races,” such as Jews, Slavs, and all nonwhites, were deemed fit only to serve the Aryans. A third element of Nazism was national expansion. Hitler believed that for Germany to thrive, it needed more lebensraum, or living space. One of the Nazis’ aims, as Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf, was “to secure for the German people the land and soil to which they are entitled on this earth,” even if this could be accomplished only by “the might of a victorious sword.” The Great Depression helped the Nazis come to power. Because of war debts and dependence on American loans and investments, Germany’s economy was hit hard. By 1932 some 6 million Germans were unemployed. Many men who were out of work joined Hitler’s private army, the “storm troopers” (or “Brown Shirts”). The German people were desperate and turned to Hitler as their last hope. By mid-1932, the Nazis had become the strongest political party in Germany. In January 1933 Hitler was appointed chancellor (prime minister). Once in power, Hitler quickly dismantled Germany’s democratic Weimar Republic. In its place he established the Third Reich, or Third German Empire. According to Hitler, the Third Reich would be a “Thousand-Year Reich”—it would last for a thousand years.
### MILITARISTS GAIN CONTROL IN JAPAN 
Halfway around the world, Japan was another country torn by political and economic conflict. Among the problems facing Japan was the limited size of its territory. The islands of Japan were growing crowded. At the time, Japan’s government was under civilian control. Many Japanese, however, were unhappy with their leaders. Dissatisfaction was especially high among members of the military who held strong nationalist beliefs. In the early 1930s a group of military leaders used violence to take control of the imperial government of Japan. Like Hitler and Mussolini, these leaders believed in the need for a strong army to accomplish their country’s goals, a philosophy known as militarism. Also like Hitler, they felt the need for more living space for a growing population. Many Japanese wanted to expand their territory and gain greater access to wealth and resources. This desire grew even stronger as a result of the worldwide economic depression of the 1930s.
### CIVIL WAR BREAKS OUT IN SPAIN 
In 1936 a group of Spanish army officers led by General Francisco Franco rebelled against the Spanish republic. Revolts broke out all over Spain, and the Spanish Civil War began. The war aroused passions not only in Spain but also throughout the world. About 3,000 Americans formed the Abraham Lincoln Battalion and traveled to Spain to fight against Franco. “We knew, we just knew,” recalled Martha Gellhorn, “that Spain was the place to stop fascism.” Such limited aid was not sufficient to stop the spread of fascism, however. The Western democracies remained neutral. Although the Soviet Union sent equipment and advisers, Hitler and Mussolini backed Franco’s forces with troops, weapons, tanks, and fighter planes. The war forged a close relationship between the German and Italian dictators, who signed a formal alliance known as the Rome-Berlin Axis. After a loss of almost 500,000 lives, Franco’s victory in 1939 established him as Spain’s fascist dictator. Once again a totalitarian government ruled in Europe
## Dictators Expand Their Territory 
Having established their totalitarian regimes, many dictators sought to increase their territories, often through military action. Unfortunately the League of Nations, which had been established after World War I to prevent such aggressive acts, did little to thwart their efforts.
### JAPAN’S AMBITIONS IN THE PACIFIC 
In 1931 the militarists in control of Japan’s government began working in earnest to achieve their goals of growing Japan’s territory and access to resources. Ignoring the protests of more moderate Japanese officials, they launched a surprise attack and seized control of the Chinese province of Manchuria. Within several months, Japanese troops controlled the entire province, a large region about twice the size of Texas that was rich in natural resources. This action was a significant test of the power of the League of Nations. The League sent representatives to Manchuria to investigate the situation. Their report condemned Japan, who in turn simply quit the League. Meanwhile, the success of the Manchurian invasion put the militarists firmly in control of Japan’s government. As Germany began to expand its territory in Europe, it opened new opportunities for Japanese expansionists. Already in control of Manchuria, in July 1937 Hideki Tojo (hēʹd-kē tōʹjō´), chief of staff of Japan’s Kwantung Army, launched an invasion farther into China. As French, Dutch, and British colonies lay unprotected in Asia, Japanese leaders leaped at the opportunity to unite East Asia under Japanese control by seizing the colonial lands.
### AGGRESSION IN EUROPE AND AFRICA 
The failure of the League of Nations to take action against Japan did not escape the notice of Europe’s dictators. In 1933 Hitler pulled Germany out of the League of Nations. In 1935 he began a military buildup in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. A year later he sent troops into the Rhineland, a German region bordering France and Belgium that was demilitarized as a result of the Treaty of Versailles. The League did nothing to stop Hitler. Meanwhile, Mussolini began building his new Roman Empire. His first target was Ethiopia, one of Africa’s few remaining independent countries. By the fall of 1935, tens of thousands of Italian soldiers stood ready to advance on Ethiopia. The League of Nations reacted with brave talk of “collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression.” When the invasion began, however, the League’s response was an ineffective economic boycott—little more than a slap on Italy’s wrist. By May 1936 Ethiopia had fallen. In desperation, Haile Selassie, the ousted Ethiopian emperor, appealed to the League for assistance. Nothing was done. “It is us today,” he told them. “It will be you tomorrow.”
### AUSTRIA AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA FALL 
On November 5, 1937, Hitler met secretly with his top military advisers. He boldly declared that to grow and prosper Germany needed the land of its neighbors. His plan was to absorb Austria and Czechoslovakia into the Third Reich. When one of his advisers protested that annexing those countries could provoke war, Hitler replied, “‘The German Question’ can be solved only by means of force, and this is never without risk.” Austria was Hitler’s first target. The Paris Peace Conference following World War I had created the relatively small nation of Austria out of what was left of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The majority of Austria’s 6 million people were Germans who favored unification with Germany. On March 12, 1938, German troops marched into Austria unopposed. A day later Germany announced that its Anschluss, or “union,” with Austria was complete. The United States and the rest of the world did nothing. Hitler then turned to Czechoslovakia. About 3 million German- speaking people lived in the western border regions of Czechoslovakia which were called the Sudetenland. The mountainous region formed Czechoslovakia’s main defense against German attack. Hitler wanted to annex Czechoslovakia to provide more living space for Germany as well as to control its important natural resources. Hitler charged that the Czechs were abusing the Sudeten Germans, and he began massing troops on the Czech border. The U.S. correspondent William Shirer, then stationed in Berlin, wrote in his diary: “The Nazi press [is] full of hysterical headlines. All lies. Some examples: ‘Women and Children Mowed Down by Czech Armored Cars,’ or ‘Bloody Regime—New Czech Murders of Germans.’” Early in the crisis, both France and Great Britain promised to protect Czechoslovakia. Then, just when war seemed inevitable, Hitler invited French premier Édouard Daladier and British prime minister Neville Chamberlain to meet with him in Munich. When they arrived, the führer declared that the annexation of the Sudetenland would be his “last territorial demand.” In their eagerness to avoid war, Daladier and Chamberlain chose to believe him. On September 30, 1938, they signed the Munich Agreement, which turned the Sudetenland over to Germany without a single shot being fired. Chamberlain returned home and proclaimed: “My friends, there has come back from Germany peace with honor. I believe it is peace in our time.” Chamberlain’s satisfaction was not shared by Winston Churchill, Chamberlain’s political rival in Great Britain. In Churchill’s view, by signing the Munich Agreement, Daladier and Chamberlain had adopted a shameful policy of appeasement—or giving up principles to pacify an aggressor. As Churchill bluntly put it, “Britain and France had to choose between war and dishonor. They chose dishonor. They will have war.” Nonetheless, the House of Commons approved Chamberlain’s policy toward Germany and Churchill responded with a warning
## The German Offensive 
As Churchill had warned, Hitler was not finished expanding the Third Reich. As dawn broke on March 15, 1939, German troops poured into what remained of Czechoslovakia. At nightfall Hitler gloated, “Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist.” After that, the German dictator turned his land-hungry gaze toward Germany’s eastern neighbor, Poland. 
### THE SOVIET UNION DECLARES NEUTRALITY 
Like Czechoslovakia, Poland had a sizable German-speaking population. In the spring of 1939, Hitler began his familiar routine, charging that Germans in Poland were mistreated by the Poles and needed his protection. Some people thought that this time Hitler must have been bluffing. After all, an attack on Poland might bring Germany into conflict with the Soviet Union, Poland’s eastern neighbor. At the same time, such an attack would most likely provoke a declaration of war from France and Britain—both of whom had promised military aid to Poland. The result would be a two-front war. Fighting on two fronts had exhausted Germany in World War I. Surely, many thought, Hitler would not be foolish enough to repeat that mistake. As tensions rose over Poland, Stalin surprised everyone when he signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler. Once bitter enemies, on August 23, 1939, fascist Germany and Communist Russia now committed never to attack each other. Germany and the Soviet Union also signed a second, secret pact, agreeing to divide Poland between them. With the danger of a two-front war eliminated, the fate of Poland was sealed.
### BLITZKRIEG IN POLAND 
As day broke on September 1, 1939, the German Luftwaffe, or German air force, roared over Poland, raining bombs on military bases, airfields, railroads, and cities. At the same time, German tanks raced across the Polish countryside, spreading terror and confusion. This invasion was the initial test of Germany’s newest military strategy, the blitzkrieg, or lightning war. Blitzkrieg made use of advances in military technology—such as fast tanks that had been adapted to move quickly over rough terrain and more powerful aircraft that could travel over longer distances—to take the enemy by surprise and then quickly crush all opposition with overwhelming force. On September 3, two days following the terror in Poland, Britain and France declared war on Germany. The blitzkrieg tactics worked perfectly. Major fighting was over in three weeks, long before France, Britain, and their allies could mount a defense. In the last week of fighting, the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east, grabbing some of its territory. The portion Germany annexed in western Poland contained almost two-thirds of Poland’s population. By the end of the month, Poland had ceased to exist—and World War II had begun.
### THE PHONY WAR 
For several months after the fall of Poland, French and British troops on the Maginot Line, a system of fortifications built along France’s eastern border, sat staring into Germany, waiting for something to happen. On the Siegfried Line a few miles away German troops stared back. The blitzkrieg had given way to what the Germans called the sitzkrieg (“sitting war”), and what some newspapers referred to as the phony war. After occupying eastern Poland, Stalin began annexing the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Late in 1939 Stalin sent his Soviet army into Finland. After three months of fighting, the outnumbered Finns surrendered. Suddenly, on April 9, 1940, Hitler launched a surprise invasion of Denmark and Norway in order “to protect [those countries’] freedom and independence.” But in truth, Hitler planned to build bases along the coasts to strike at Great Britain. Next, Hitler turned against the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, which were overrun by the end of May. The phony war had ended. 
### THE FALL OF FRANCE 
France’s Maginot Line proved to be ineffective; the German army threatened to bypass the line during its invasion of Belgium. Hitler’s generals sent their tanks through the Ardennes, a region of wooded ravines in northeast France, thereby avoiding British and French troops who thought the Ardennes were impassable. The Germans continued to march toward Paris. The German offensive trapped almost 400,000 British and French soldiers as they fled to the beaches of Dunkirk on the French side of the English Channel. In less than a week, a makeshift fleet of fishing trawlers, tug boats, river barges, and pleasure craft—more than 800 vessels in all—ferried about 330,000 British, French, and Belgian troops to safety across the Channel. A few days later Italy entered the war on the side of Germany and invaded France from the south as the Germans closed in on Paris from the north. On June 22, 1940, at Compiègne, as William Shirer and the rest of the world watched, Hitler handed French officers his terms of surrender. Germans would occupy the northern part of France, and a Nazi-controlled puppet government, headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain, would be set up at Vichy in southern France. After France fell, a French general named Charles de Gaulle fled to England, where he set up a government-in-exile. De Gaulle proclaimed defiantly, “France has lost a battle, but France has not lost the war.”
### THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN 
In the summer of 1940, the Germans began to assemble an invasion fleet along the French coast. Because its naval power could not compete with that of Britain, Germany also launched an air war at the same time. The Luftwaffe began making bombing runs over Britain. Its goal was to gain total control of the skies by destroying Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF). Hitler had 2,600 planes at his disposal. On a single day—August 15—approximately 2,000 German planes ranged over Britain. Bombers pounded London every night for two solid months. The Battle of Britain raged on through the summer and fall. Night after night, German planes pounded British targets. At first the Luftwaffe concentrated on airfields and aircraft. Next it targeted cities. The RAF fought back brilliantly. With the help of a new technological device called radar, British pilots accurately plotted the flight paths of German planes, even in darkness. On September 15, 1940 the RAF shot down over 185 German planes; at the same time, they lost only 26 aircraft. Six weeks later Hitler called off the invasion of Britain indefinitely. “Never in the field of human conflict,” said Churchill in praise of the RAF pilots, “was so much owed by so many to so few.” Still, German bombers continued to pound Britain’s cities trying to disrupt production and break civilian morale. Even late in the war, when the Luftwaffe had been weakened and no longer had enough planes to send to Britain, the bombing continued. German scientists developed two types of rockets, the V-1 and the V-2, that could rain devastation on British cities from launch sites on the European mainland. At the same time, British pilots also bombed German cities. Civilians in both countries unrelentingly carried on.
# Holocaust
## The Persecution Begins 
On April 7, 1933, shortly after Hitler took power in Germany, he ordered all “non-Aryans” to be removed from government jobs. This order was one of the first moves in a campaign for racial purity. That campaign eventually led to the Holocaust, the systematic murder of 6 million Jews across Europe. The Nazis also murdered 5 million other people. 
### JEWS TARGETED 
Although Jews were not the only victims of the Holocaust, they were the main Nazi targets. Anti-Semitism, or hatred of the Jews, had a long history in parts of Europe. For decades many Germans had been looking for a scapegoat. They blamed the Jews as the cause of their failures. Adolf Hitler rose to power in part by promising to return Germany to its former glory. Hitler found that a majority of Germans were willing to support his belief that Jews were responsible for Germany’s economic problems and defeat in World War I. He also told the Germans that they came from a superior race, the Aryans, an idea that was found in German music and folktales. Hitler effectively used this notion to build support for his plans. As the Nazis tightened their hold on Germany, their persecution of the Jews increased. In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws stripped Jews of their German citizenship, jobs, and property. Jews had to wear a bright yellow Star of David attached to their clothing to make it easier for the Nazis to identify them. Worse things were yet to come. 
### KRISTALLNACHT 
November 9–10, 1938, became known as Kristallnacht (krĭsʹtälʹnächt´), or “Night of Broken Glass.” Nazi storm troopers attacked Jewish homes, businesses, and synagogues across Germany, Austria, and the recently occupied Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. The Nazis claimed the attacks were a spontaneous reaction to the assassination of a Nazi official by a Jewish teenager. In fact, Nazi officials encouraged the violence. During the rampage, thousands of Jewish businesses and places of worship were damaged or destroyed. An American who witnessed the violence wrote, “Jewish shop windows by the hundreds were systematically and wantonly smashed. . . . The main streets of the city were a positive litter of shattered plate glass.” Around 100 Jews were killed, and hundreds more were injured. Some 30,000 Jews were arrested. Afterward, the Nazis blamed the Jews for the destruction and held them financially responsible. Jews were fined a total of 1 billion marks.
### A FLOOD OF JEWISH REFUGEES 
Kristallnacht marked an increase in the Nazis’ Jewish persecution and sent a clear message to those Jews still in Germany. Over 100,000 managed to leave in the months following the attacks. However, many had trouble finding countries that would accept them. Nazi laws had left many German Jews without money or property, and most countries were unwilling to take in poor immigrants. France already had 40,000 Jewish refugees and did not want more. The British worried about fueling anti-Semitism. They refused to admit more than 80,000 Jewish refugees. The British also controlled the Palestine Mandate, part of which later became Israel. They did allow 30,000 refugees to settle there. Late in 1938 Germany’s foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, observed, “We all want to get rid of our Jews. The difficulty is that no country wishes to receive them.” Although the average Jew had little chance of reaching the United States, “persons of exceptional merit” were allowed in. Physicist Albert Einstein, author Thomas Mann, architect Walter Gropius, and theologian Paul Tillich were among 100,000 refugees the United States accepted. Many Americans wanted the door closed. Americans were concerned that letting in more refugees during the Great Depression would deny jobs to U.S. citizens. They also thought it would threaten economic recovery. Among Americans, there was widespread anti-Semitism and fear that “enemy agents” would enter the country. President Roosevelt said that he sympathized with the Jews. But he also said that he would not “do anything which would conceivably hurt the future of present American citizens.” 
### THE PLIGHT OF THE ST. LOUIS 
Official indifference to the situation of Germany’s Jews was clear in the case of the ship St. Louis. This German ocean liner passed Miami, Florida, in 1939. Although 740 of the liner’s 943 passengers had U.S. immigration papers, the Coast Guard followed the ship to prevent anyone from getting off in America. The ship was forced to return to Europe. “The cruise of the St. Louis,” wrote the New York Times, “cries to high heaven of man’s inhumanity to man.” Passenger Liane ReifLehrer recalls her childhood experiences. “My mother and brother and I were among the passengers who survived. . . . We were sent back to Europe and given haven in France, only to find the Nazis on our doorstep again a few months later.”  More than half of the passengers were later killed in the Holocaust.
## Hitler’s “Final Solution”
By 1939 only about a quarter million Jews remained in Germany. But other nations that Hitler occupied had millions more. Obsessed with a desire to rid Europe of its Jews, Hitler imposed what he called the “Final Solution”—a policy of genocide, the deliberate and systematic killing of an entire population.
### THE CONDEMNED 
Hitler’s Final Solution rested on the belief that Aryans were a superior people and that the strength and purity of this “master race” must be preserved. To accomplish this, the Nazis condemned the Jews to slavery and death. They did the same to other groups that they viewed as inferior or unworthy or as “enemies of the state.” After taking power in 1933, the Nazis had concentrated on silencing their political opponents: communists, socialists, liberals, and anyone else who spoke out against the government. Once the Nazis had eliminated these enemies, they turned against other groups in Germany. In addition to Jews, these groups included the following: 
- Gypsies—whom the Nazis believed to be an “inferior race” 
- Freemasons—whom the Nazis charged as supporters of the “Jewish conspiracy” to rule the world 
- Jehovah’s Witnesses—who refused to join the army or salute Hitler 

The Nazis also targeted other Germans whom they found unfit to be part of the “master race.” Such victims included homosexuals, the mentally deficient, the mentally ill, the physically disabled, and the incurably ill. Hitler began implementing his Final Solution in Poland with special Nazi death squads. Hitler’s elite Nazi “security squadrons” (or SS), rounded up Jewish men, women, children, and babies, and shot them on the spot.
### FORCED RELOCATION 
Jews also were ordered into dismal, overcrowded ghettos, segregated Jewish areas in certain Polish cities. The Nazis sealed off the ghettos with barbed wire and stone walls. Those Jews who tried to leave were shot. Life inside the ghetto was miserable. Food was scarce. Diseases spread quickly in the cramped conditions, and many Jews fell ill. The bodies of victims of the death squads piled up in the streets faster than they could be removed. Factories were built alongside ghettos where people were forced to work for German industry. In spite of the impossible living conditions, the Jews hung on. While some formed resistance movements inside the ghettos, others resisted by other means. They published and distributed underground newspapers. Secret schools were set up to educate Jewish children. Even theater and music groups continued to operate.
### CONCENTRATION CAMPS 
Finally, Jews in communities not reached by the killing squads were dragged from their homes and herded onto trains or trucks for shipment to concentration camps, or labor camps. Families were often separated, sometimes—like the Weissmanns—forever. Nazi concentration camps were originally set up to imprison political opponents and protesters. The camps were later turned over to the SS, who expanded the concentration camps and used them to warehouse other “undesirables.” Life in the camps was a cycle of hunger, humiliation, and work that almost always ended in death. The prisoners were crammed into crude wooden barracks that held up to a thousand people each. They shared their crowded quarters, as well as their meager meals, with hordes of rats and fleas. One survivor remembered such intense hunger “that if a bit of soup spilled over, prisoners would converge on the spot, dig their spoons into the mud and stuff the mess into their mouths.” Inmates in the camps worked from dawn to dusk, seven days a week, until they collapsed. Those too weak to work were killed.
## The Final Stage 
The Final Solution reached its final stage in early 1942. Hitler called his top officials to a meeting held in Wannsee, a suburb near Berlin. There they agreed to a new phase of the mass murder of Jews. Nazis already were using mass slaughter and starvation. Now they would add murder by poison gas. 
### MASS EXTERMINATIONS 
Overwork, starvation, beatings, and bullets did not kill fast enough to satisfy the Nazis. The Germans built six death camps in Poland. The first, Chelmno, began operating in 1941—before the meeting at Wannsee. Each camp had several huge gas chambers. As many as 12,000 people a day could be killed in them. Auschwitz was the largest of the death camps. When prisoners arrived there, they had to walk past several SS doctors. The doctors separated those strong enough to work from those who would die that day. Both groups had to leave all their belongings behind, supposedly to be returned to them later. Those assigned to die were taken to a room outside the gas chamber. They were told to undress for a shower and were even given pieces of soap. Finally, they were led into the chamber and poisoned with cyanide gas that came out of vents in the walls. Sometimes an orchestra of camp inmates played cheerful music during the killings. Those inmates had been temporarily spared from death because of their musical abilities. At first the bodies were buried in huge pits. At Belzec, Rudolf Reder was part of a 500-man death brigade that worked all day, he said, “either at grave digging or emptying the gas chambers.” But the decaying corpses gave off an odor that could be smelled for miles around. Worse yet, mass graves left evidence of the mass murder. At some camps, Nazis tried to cover up the evidence of their slaughter. They installed huge crematoriums, or ovens, in which to burn the dead. At other camps, the bodies were simply thrown into a pit and set on fire. Gassing was not the only method of extermination used in the camps. Prisoners were also shot, hanged, or injected with poison. Others died from horrible medical experiments done by camp doctors. Some of these victims were injected with deadly germs. The SS doctors wanted to study the effect of disease on different groups of people. Many more inmates were used to test methods of sterilization. Some Nazi doctors were interested in this as a possible way to improve the “master race.”
### THE GLOBAL RESPONSE 
In the United States, news of the Nazi violence against European Jews was not always noticeably reported. Anti-Jewish violence increased from 1939 to 1941. After that, some newspapers carried stories about German shooting operations in Poland and the Soviet Union. However, the victims’ ethnic background was not always identified. Also, the fate of Europe’s Jews was just one of many issues of concern to the United States. The war was the main focus of many countries’ attention. By 1942 the world began to become aware of the horrifying details of Hitler’s Final Solution. That year, one escapee from a concentration camp, Jacob Grojanowski, published a report of his experiences in the camp. From Poland, the report made its way to London and then to other parts of Europe. Also in 1942, Gerhart Riegner, the head of a major Jewish organization in Switzerland, sent a report to the U.S. State Department about the atrocities occurring in Europe. Those who read these reports or heard them described on the radio were horrified by their contents. Leaders of the Allied nations publicly condemned the Nazis for their disgraceful actions. The response to the Holocaust varied by nation and by individual. Some risked their own lives to save Jews from the Nazis. In 1942 King Christian X rejected the Nazis’ demand to enforce the Nuremberg Laws against the Jews in German-occupied Denmark. Almost all of Denmark’s Jews were rescued by being taken to Sweden in boats. Aristides de Sousa Mendes, a Portuguese diplomat stationed in France, defied his government’s orders to deny entry to Jewish refugees. Instead he issued some 10,000 visas to Jews seeking to enter Portugal. The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg issued “protective passports” that allowed thousands of Hungarian Jews to escape the Nazi death camps. Even citizens of Germany lent a hand. And Sempo Sugihara, Japanese consul in Lithuania, helped over 6,000 Jews to escape the Nazis’ clutches, an act that cost him his career. The United States did not immediately take steps to protect Europe’s Jewish population. Many observers have criticized that inaction. In part, the U.S. government was unsure how to arrange rescue operations in Europe. It was also unsure of what the outcome of those operations would be. It was not until January 1944 that President Roosevelt announced the creation of the War Refugee Board. The task of this organization was to rescue thousands of Jews in Hungary, Romania, and other parts of Europe. Those Jews might otherwise have fallen into the hands of the Nazis. In the spring of 1944, some Jewish organizations received detailed reports about the mass murders by gassing happening at Auschwitz. Those organizations proposed bombing the camp. The U.S. War Department refused, uncertain of the results. Theyexplained that they were not able to carry out a bombing raid with enough accuracy. They also argued that the best way to help the Jews was to end the war as quickly as possible. The War Department believed its focus should be exclusively on military targets.
### THE SURVIVORS 
An estimated six million Jews died in the death camps and in the Nazi massacres. But some miraculously escaped the worst of the Holocaust. Many had help from ordinary people who were appalled by the Nazis’ treatment of Jews. Some Jews even managed to survive the horrors of the concentration camps. In Gerda Weissmann Klein’s view, survival depended as much on one’s spirit as on getting enough to eat. “I do believe that if you were blessed with imagination, you could work through it,” she wrote. “If, unfortunately, you were a person that faced reality, I think you didn’t have much of a chance.” Those who did come out of the camps alive were forever changed by what they had witnessed. For survivor Elie Wiesel, who entered Auschwitz at the age of 15, the sun had set forever. Although he survived his ordeal, Wiesel’s experiences in Auschwitz irrevocably altered his worldview. After his liberation in 1945, Wiesel moved to France where he studied and became a journalist. He first recorded memoirs of his time in Auschwitz in Yiddish in 1956. The work, which was published as Night in 1960, has become known as one of the great pieces of Holocaust literature. Wiesel became a noted lecturer about the Holocaust. His work condemning violence, hatred, and oppression brought him worldwide fame, and in 1986 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
# America Moves Toward War
## Isolationism Amidst Conflict 
Most Americans were alarmed by the international conflicts of the mid-1930s. But they believed that the United States should not get involved. Since World War I, the United States had kept a policy of isolationism. The nation’s leaders avoided any action that would involve the United States in global affairs. 
### THE ROOTS OF ISOLATIONISM 
Because of the horrors of World War I, many Americans were determined never to be involved in an international war again. In 1919 Congress refused to allow the United States to join the League of Nations. They feared that the league would control American foreign policy. They also feared that it would tie the country too closely to Europe. After World War I, the United States made sure that it would not be pulled into war again. At the Washington Naval Conference of 1921, the United States and its allies signed a disarmament treaty. They also promised not to build any warships during the next decade. In 1928 the United States signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The treaty was signed by 62 countries. It stated that war would not be used “as an instrument of national policy.” Yet it did not include a way to deal with countries that broke their pledge. Therefore, the Pact was only a small step toward peace. 
### AMERICANS CLING TO ISOLATIONISM 
In the early 1930s numerous books argued that greedy bankers and arms dealers had dragged the United States into World War I. Public outrage led a congressional committee to investigate these charges. North Dakota senator Gerald Nye chaired the committee. The Nye committee found that banks and manufacturers had made large profits during the war. Anger grew over these “merchants of death.” Americans became even more determined to avoid war. Antiwar feeling was very strong. The Girl Scouts of America even changed the color of its uniforms to green. The original khaki was similar to the color used by the military. News of Japan’s invasion of Manchuria reached the United States in 1932. The U.S. government avoided getting involved. Secretary of State Henry Stimson’s response was supported by President Hoover. Stimson notified the governments of both Japan and China that the United States would not recognize the conflict. The U.S. government would continue to consider Manchuria a part of China. The Hoover-Stimson note also insisted that Americans kept all their trade rights in China. Americans’ growing isolationism eventually affected President Roosevelt’s foreign policy. When he first took office in 1933, Roosevelt reached out to other nations in several ways. He officially recognized the Soviet Union in 1933 and agreed to exchange ambassadors with Moscow. His Good Neighbor Policy continued the nonintervention policy in Latin America begun by Presidents Coolidge and Hoover. Roosevelt also withdrew armed forces stationed there. In 1934 Roosevelt pushed Congress to pass the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act. It lowered trade barriers by giving the president the power to make trade agreements with other nations. It was aimed at reducing tariffs by as much as 50 percent. Congress, however, disagreed with Roosevelt’s efforts to involve the country in foreign affairs. In 1934 it passed the Johnson Debt Default Act, which prohibited any foreign aid loans to countries that had not paid back their World War I debts. Congress also passed a series of Neutrality Acts to keep the country out of future wars. The first two acts, passed in 1935 and 1937, outlawed arms sales or loans to nations at war. The third act was passed in 1939 in response to the fighting in Spain. This act prohibited arms sales and loans to nations engaged in civil wars. 
### NEUTRALITY BREAKS DOWN 
Even though Congress passed laws to keep the country neutral, Roosevelt found it impossible to remain neutral. When Japan launched a new attack on China in July 1937, Roosevelt found a way around the Neutrality Acts. Because Japan had not formally declared war against China, the president claimed there was no need to enforce the Neutrality Acts. The United States continued sending arms and supplies to China. A few months later Roosevelt spoke out strongly against isolationism in a speech delivered in Chicago. He called on peaceloving nations to “quarantine,” or isolate, aggressor nations in order to stop the spread of war. At last Roosevelt seemed ready to take a stand against aggression— until isolationist newspapers exploded in protest. They accused the president of leading the nation into war. Roosevelt backed off as a result of this criticism, but his speech did begin to shift the debate. For the moment the conflicts remained “over there.”
## Moving Away from Neutrality 
As German tanks rolled across Poland, Roosevelt revised the Neutrality Act of 1935. At the same time, he began to prepare the nation for the struggle he feared lay just ahead. 
### CAUTIOUS STEPS 
In September 1939 Roosevelt persuaded Congress to pass a “cash-and-carry” provision. It allowed warring nations to buy U.S. arms as long as they paid cash and transported them in their own ships. Roosevelt argued that providing the arms would help France and Britain defeat Hitler and keep the United States out of the war. Isolationists attacked Roosevelt for his actions. However, after six weeks of heated debate, Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1939, and a cash-and-carry policy went into effect. 
### THE AXIS THREAT 
The United States’s cash-and-carry policy seemed like too little, too late. By summer 1940 France had fallen and Britain was under siege. Roosevelt worked to provide the British with “all aid short of war.” By June he had sent Britain 500,000 rifles and 80,000 machine guns. In early September the United States traded 50 old destroyers for leases on British military bases in the Caribbean and Newfoundland. British prime minister Winston Churchill would later recall this move with affection as “a decidedly unneutral act.” On September 27 Americans were startled by the news that Germany, Italy, and Japan had signed a mutual defense treaty, the Tripartite Pact. The three nations became known as the Axis powers. The Tripartite Pact was intended to keep the United States out of the war. Under the treaty each Axis nation agreed to defend the others in case of attack. This meant that if the United States declared war on any one of the Axis powers, it would have to fight a two-ocean war, in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. 
### BUILDING U.S. DEFENSES 
Meanwhile, Roosevelt asked Congress to increase spending for national defense. Despite years of U.S. isolationism, Nazi victories in 1940 changed U.S. thinking. Congress boosted defense spending. Congress also passed the nation’s first peacetime military draft—the Selective Training and Service Act. Under this law 16 million men between the ages of 21 and 35 were registered. Of these, one million would be drafted for one year. They were allowed to serve only in the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt drew the first draft numbers. He told a national radio audience, “This is a most solemn ceremony.” 
### ROOSEVELT RUNS FOR A THIRD TERM 
That same year, Roosevelt broke the tradition of a two-term presidency begun by George Washington. He decided to run for reelection. Roosevelt’s Republican opponent was a public utilities executive named Wendell Willkie. He supported Roosevelt’s policy of aiding Britain, which disappointed isolationists. At the same time, both Willkie and Roosevelt promised to keep the nation out of war. Because there was so little difference between the candidates, the majority of voters chose the one they knew better. Roosevelt was reelected with nearly 55 percent of the votes cast. Not long after the election, President Roosevelt continued his drive to provide aid to the Allies in their fight against the Axis powers. He told his radio audience during a fireside chat that it would be impossible to negotiate a peace with Hitler. “No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it.” He warned that if Britain fell, the Axis powers would be left unchallenged to conquer the world. At that point, he said, “all of us in all the Americas would be living at the point of a gun.” To prevent such a situation, the United States had to help defeat the Axis threat. It had to become what Roosevelt called “the great arsenal of democracy.” 
### THE LEND-LEASE PLAN 
By late 1940 Britain had no more cash to spend on arms. In addition, as a result of the Johnson Debt Default Act, Roosevelt was unable to lend money to Britain directly. Instead, he tried to help by suggesting a new plan that he called a lend-lease policy. Under this plan the president would lend or lease arms and other supplies to “any country whose defense was vital to the United States.” Roosevelt compared his plan to lending a garden hose to a neighbor whose house was on fire. He maintained that this was the only sensible thing to do to prevent the fire from spreading to your own property. Isolationists opposed the plan, but most Americans favored it. Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act in March 1941. Britain was not the only nation to receive lend-lease aid. In June 1941 Hitler broke the agreement he had made in 1939 with Stalin not to go to war and invaded the Soviet Union. Acting on the principle that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” Roosevelt worked to improve the diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. He began sending lend-lease supplies to the Soviets. Some Americans opposed providing aid to Stalin. However, Roosevelt agreed with Winston Churchill, who had said “if Hitler invaded Hell,” the British would work with the devil himself. The cooperation among these three nations laid the groundwork for what Churchill would come to call the Grand Alliance. As a result of policies such as the Lend-Lease Act, American industries began shifting to wartime production before the United States officially entered the war. Defense spending skyrocketed in 1940. Idle factories came back to life. They changed from making consumer goods to producing war supplies. A merry-go-round company began producing gun mounts, and a stove factory made lifeboats. A famous New York toymaker made compasses. A pinball-machine company made armor-piercing shells. This increase in production did what all of the programs of the New Deal could not do: it ended the Great Depression. With factories hiring again, the nation’s unemployment level began shrinking rapidly. It fell by 400,000 in August 1940 and by another 500,000 in September. By the end of 1941, America was going back to work.
## FDR Plans for War 
Although Roosevelt was popular, his foreign policy was under constant attack. Still, he recognized that American forces were seriously underarmed. Roosevelt took a number of actions to ensure that the U.S. military would be prepared for the war he was certain would come. 
### GERMAN WOLF PACKS
Lend-lease aid was helping, but supply lines across the Atlantic Ocean had to be kept open to deliver goods to Britain and the Soviet Union. Hitler tried to prevent delivery of lend-lease shipments by sending out hundreds of German submarines, or U-boats, to attack supply ships. From the spring through the fall of 1941, attacks by individual U-boats were replaced by the wolf pack attack. At night groups of up to 40 submarines patrolled areas in the North Atlantic where convoys could be expected. Wolf packs were successful in sinking as much as 350,000 tons of shipments in a single month. In June 1941 President Roosevelt granted the navy permission for U.S. warships to attack German U-boats in self-defense. 
### THE ATLANTIC CHARTER
In August 1941 Roosevelt and Churchill met secretly at a summit aboard the battleship USS Augusta. Although Churchill hoped for a military commitment, he settled for a joint declaration of war goals called the Atlantic Charter. Both countries pledged collective security, disarmament, self-determination, economic cooperation, and freedom of the seas. Roosevelt told Churchill that he couldn’t ask Congress for a declaration of war against Germany. But he said that he “would wage war” and do “everything” to “force an incident.” The Atlantic Charter became the basis of a new document called “A Declaration of the United Nations.” Roosevelt suggested the term United Nations to express the common purpose of the Allies, those nations that fought the Axis powers. The declaration was signed on January 1, 1942, by 26 nations: Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Great Britain, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, South Africa, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Yugoslavia. By the end of the war, another 21 countries had added their signatures. 
### SHOOT ON SIGHT 
After a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer Greer in the Atlantic on September 4, 1941, Roosevelt ordered navy commanders to respond. “When you see a rattlesnake poised to strike,” the president explained, “you crush him.” Roosevelt ordered the navy to shoot the German submarines on sight. Two weeks later the Pink Star, an American merchant ship, was sunk off Greenland. In mid-October a U-boat sank the U.S. destroyer Kearny, and 11 lives were lost. Days later German U-boats torpedoed the U.S. destroyer Reuben James, killing more than 100 sailors. “America has been attacked,” Roosevelt announced grimly. “The shooting has started. And history has recorded who fired the first shot.” As the death toll mounted, the Senate repealed a ban against arming merchant ships. A formal declaration of a full-scale war seemed inevitable.
## Japan Attacks the United States 
The United States was now involved in an undeclared naval war with Hitler. However, the attack that finally brought the United States into the war came from Japan. By the late fall of 1941, American leaders had become convinced that war between the United States and Japan was likely. The only remaining question was how and where the fighting would start. 
### ECONOMIC MOTIVATIONS
By early 1941 the Japanese had already pushed westward into Manchuria and other parts of China. They also set their sights on the European colonial possessions to the south. By 1941 the European powers were too busy fighting Hitler to block Japanese expansion. Only the United States and its Pacific islands remained in Japan’s way. The Japanese began a southward push in July 1941. They took over French military bases in Indochina (now Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos). The United States protested this aggression by halting trade with Japan. One item that Japan could not live without was oil for its war machine. Japanese military leaders warned that a lack of oil could defeat Japan without its enemies ever striking a blow. The leaders declared that Japan must either persuade the United States to end its oil embargo or capture the oil fields in the Dutch East Indies. Any attack on the East Indies, though, would mean war. 
### PEACE TALKS ARE QUESTIONED
Shortly after becoming the prime minister of Japan, Hideki Tojo met with emperor Hirohito. Tojo promised the emperor that the Japanese government would try to keep peace with the Americans. But on November 5, 1941, Tojo ordered the Japanese navy to prepare an attack on the United States. The U.S. military had broken Japan’s secret communication codes. It learned that Japan was preparing an attack. But it didn’t know where the attack would happen. Late in November Roosevelt sent a “war warning” to military commanders in Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines. If war could not be avoided, the warning said, “the United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act.” And the nation waited. After the embargo began, representatives of the two nations met to try to settle their growing differences. U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull held several meetings with the Japanese ambassador. The United States wanted Japan to pull out of China, but the Japanese refused. The peace talks went on until December 6, 1941, when Roosevelt received a decoded message. It instructed Japan’s peace envoy to refuse all American peace proposals. “This means war,” Roosevelt declared. 
### THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR 
Early the next morning, a Japanese dive-bomber flew low over Pearl Harbor—the largest U.S. naval base in the Pacific. The bomber was followed by more than 180 Japanese warplanes from six aircraft carriers. Japanese bombs began falling on the base. A radio operator sent this message: “Air raid on Pearl Harbor. This is not a drill.” For an hour and a half, the Japanese planes attacked. The U.S. antiaircraft guns had little effect, and the planes hit target after target. By the time the last plane flew away around 9:30 a.m., there was widespread devastation. The Japanese goal had been to weaken U.S. naval power in the Pacific. They thought that this would keep the Americans from preventing Japanese expansion, and they were successful. In less than two hours, the Japanese had killed 2,403 Americans and wounded 1,178 more. The surprise attack had sunk or damaged 21 ships, including 8 battleships—nearly the whole U.S. Pacific fleet. More than 300 aircraft were severely damaged or destroyed. This damage was greater than the U.S. Navy had suffered in all of World War I. By chance, three aircraft carriers at sea escaped the disaster. Their survival would be key to the war’s outcome. 
### REACTION TO PEARL HARBOR
In Washington, the mood ranged from outrage to panic. At the White House, Eleanor Roosevelt stood by as her husband received the news from Hawaii, “each report more terrible than the last.” Beneath the president’s calm, Eleanor could see how worried he was. “I never wanted to have to fight this war on two fronts,” Roosevelt told his wife. “We haven’t the Navy to fight in both the Atlantic and the Pacific . . . so we will have to build up the Navy and the Air Force and that will mean that we will have to take a good many defeats before we can have a victory.” The next day, President Roosevelt addressed Congress. In his speech, Roosevelt asked for a declaration of war against Japan, which Congress quickly approved. Three days later both Germany and Italy declared war on the United States. Terrible damage was done to Pearl Harbor. Great damage also was done to the cause of isolationism. After the surprise attack, many isolationists supported a strong American response. Isolationist senator Burton Wheeler proclaimed, “The only thing now to do is to lick the hell out of them.”
# The War Effort on the Home Front
## Americans Join the Military 
The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor expecting that after Americans experienced Japan’s power, they would shrink from further conflict. The day after the raid, the Japan Times boasted that the United States was reduced to a third-rate power and was “trembling in her shoes.” But if Americans were trembling, it was with rage, not fear. American patriotism drove citizens to incredible acts of bravery and sacrifice, on the battlefields of Europe and the Pacific as well as at home. Uniting under the battle cry “Remember Pearl Harbor!” they set out to prove Japan wrong. 
### SELECTIVE SERVICE AND THE GI 
After Pearl Harbor, patriotic young Americans jammed recruiting offices. “I wanted to be a hero, let’s face it,” admitted Roger Tuttrup. “I was havin’ trouble in school. . . . The war’d been goin’ on for two years. I didn’t wanna miss it. . . . I was an American. I was seventeen.” Even the 5 million who volunteered for military service, however, were not enough to face the challenge of an all-out war on two fronts—Europe and the Pacific. The Selective Service System expanded the draft and eventually provided another 10 million soldiers to meet the armed forces’ needs. All of the Americans entering the armed forces needed training and housing. This required building hundreds of new military bases and training centers. In general, the military wanted to build new bases in rural areas where there was plenty of open land. A warm climate was also important. The military buildup changed many parts of the country. California became home to more military bases than any other state. In Florida, Camp Blanding had 55,000 soldiers and became the state’s fourth-largest city almost overnight. Volunteers and draftees reported to these and other military bases around the country. There they received eight weeks of basic training. In this short period, seasoned sergeants did their best to turn raw recruits into disciplined, battle-ready GIs. Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall was the leader of the armed forces mobilization effort. He ensured that American soldiers were well equipped and properly trained. Marshall also played an important role in developing the nation’s military strategy. According to Sergeant Debs Myers, however, there was much more to basic training than teaching a recruit how to stand at attention, march in step, handle a rifle, and follow orders.
### EXPANDING THE MILITARY 
The military’s work force needs were so great that Marshall pushed for the formation of a Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC). “There are innumerable duties now being performed by soldiers that can be done better by women,” Marshall said in support of a bill to establish the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps. Under this bill, women volunteers would serve in noncombat positions. Some members of Congress called the bill “the silliest piece of legislation” they had ever seen. Despite their opposition, the bill establishing the WAAC became law on May 15, 1942. The law gave the WAACs an official status and salary but few of the benefits that male soldiers received. Even so, thousands of patriotic women enlisted. They wanted to help the army win the war. In July 1943 the U.S. Army dropped the “auxiliary” status and gave members of the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) full U.S. Army benefits. WACs worked as nurses, ambulance drivers, radio operators, electricians, and pilots. They performed nearly every duty not involving direct combat. More than 1,000 women who had been trained as pilots before the war also signed up for duty. They formed the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). WASPs flew noncombat missions. They transported supplies, moved aircraft between bases, and tested new planes. This freed male pilots for combat missions. Among the first women to sign up to be a WASP was Cornelia Fort. She was a civilian pilot who had witnessed the bombing of Pearl Harbor from the air. 
### RECRUITING AND DISCRIMINATION
For many minority groups—especially African Americans, Native Americans, Mexican Americans, and Asian Americans—the war created new difficulties. They were restricted to racially segregated neighborhoods and reservations. They were denied basic citizenship rights. Some members of these groups questioned whether this was their war to fight. “Why die for democracy for some foreign country when we don’t even have it here?” asked an editorial in an African American newspaper. When one African American received his draft notice, he responded unhappily, “Just carve on my tombstone, ‘Here lies a black man killed fighting a yellow man for the protection of a white man.’” Some African Americans, however, saw the war effort as an opportunity to fight this discrimination. Across the country, African American newspapers supported the Double V Campaign. Government posters with the slogan “V For Victory” inspired the campaign. It encouraged African Americans to join together to support the war effort. Double V Clubs collected money and supplies. They sponsored patriotic events and met with local leaders to promote fairer hiring practices. Their hope was that African Americans could win two victories. One would be a victory over the country’s enemies, and one would be over poor treatment at home. The nationalism that inspired these contributions also made many African Americans believe that their situation could improve. 
### DRAMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS
Despite discrimination in the military, more than 300,000 Mexican Americans joined the armed forces. Mexican Americans in Los Angeles made up only a tenth of the city’s population. However, they suffered a fifth of the city’s wartime casualties. About 1 million African Americans also served in the military. African American soldiers lived and worked in segregated units. They were limited mostly to noncombat roles. After much protest, African Americans did finally see combat beginning in April 1943. Asian Americans also took part in the struggle. More than 13,000 Chinese Americans, or about one of every five adult males, joined the armed forces. In addition, 33,000 Japanese Americans put on uniforms. Of these, several thousand volunteered to serve as spies and interpreters in the Pacific war. “During battles,” wrote an admiring officer, “they crawled up close enough to be able to hear [Japanese] officers’ commands and to make verbal translations to our soldiers.” Some 25,000 Native Americans also enlisted in the armed services, including 800 women. The willingness of Native Americans to serve led The Saturday Evening Post to comment, “We would not need the Selective Service if all volunteered like Indians.”
## The Federal Government Manages the War Effort 
The United States was much better prepared to enter World War II than it had been for World War I. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt had recognized the importance of managing the war effort. He created a series of agencies to aid in this task. The Office of War Mobilization was created in 1943 to oversee the agencies and coordinate all wartime efforts. 
### WINNING AMERICAN SUPPORT
American leaders understood that public support for the war effort was vital to its success. In June 1942 the government created the Office of War Information (OWI). This agency was responsible for spreading propaganda to influence the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the public in favor of the war effort. The OWI produced dozens of posters and films during the war. Many of these encouraged a positive vision of the United States and stressed positive actions. For example, some encouraged men to join the armed forces and women to take jobs in war industries. Others encouraged those on the home front to save essential resources, such as gasoline and aluminum. The OWI also issued warnings to the public about the dangers they faced. Drawings of Nazi or Japanese soldiers threatening small children were meant to inspire fear in Americans—and the desire to take action against the Axis nations. Another technique was to show the harmful outcomes of improper actions, such as sharing sensitive military information. Movies remained enormously popular during the war years. In the early 1940s some 85 million Americans went to the movies each week. As a result, the nation’s film industry became a major producer of wartime propaganda. Movie studios churned out patriotic films that featured soldiers and workers on the home front. The OWI helped by reviewing movie scripts for the proper messages. Moviemakers also created informational films, such as Frank Capra’s Why We Fight series. As the war dragged on, moviegoers grew tired of propaganda and war themes. Hollywood responded with musicals, romances, and other escapist fare. These were designed to take viewers away from the grim realities of war, if only for an hour or two. 
### ECONOMIC CONTROLS
Due to their experiences in World War I, government officials knew that wartime inflation could threaten the American economy. Inflation is a general rise in the level of prices. When it occurs, each dollar that a person earns will buy fewer goods and services than it did before. As war production increased, fewer consumer products would be available. With demand increasing and supplies dropping, prices seemed likely to climb. Roosevelt responded to this threat by creating the Office of Price Administration (OPA). The OPA fought inflation by freezing prices on most goods. Congress also raised income tax rates and extended the tax to millions of people who had never paid it before. As a result, workers had less to spend. This reduced consumer demand on scarce goods. In addition, the government encouraged Americans to buy war bonds with their extra cash. As a result of these measures, inflation remained below 30 percent for the entire period of World War II. This was about half the inflation level during World War I. These measures also helped fund the war effort. According to some estimates, preparations for World War II cost the U.S. government more than $300 billion. After restructuring the tax system, Congress created the withholding system of payroll deductions to collect income taxes. Employers withheld a percentage of their workers’ pay from each paycheck. Then they sent the money directly to the U.S. treasury, supplying a steady flow of funds. The money that ordinary citizens invested in war bonds also helped pay for the war. It paid for shipping, aircraft, and other weaponry produced in American factories. By war’s end, 85 million Americans had purchased war bonds, raising nearly $185 billion. Besides controlling inflation and paying for the war effort, the government had to make sure that the armed forces and war industries received the resources they needed. The War Production Board (WPB) assumed that responsibility. The WPB decided which companies would change from peacetime to wartime production. It allocated raw materials to key industries. The WPB also organized drives to collect scrap iron, tin cans, paper, rags, and cooking fat to recycle into war goods. Across America, children searched attics, cellars, garages, vacant lots, and back alleys, looking for useful junk. During one five-month-long paper drive in Chicago, schoolchildren collected 36 million pounds of old paper. Their effort was equal to about 65 pounds per child.
### CONSERVING FOOD AND OTHER GOODS 
Meeting the food needs of the military took top priority in the United States. One way to grow more food for Americans on the home front was to plant victory gardens. Americans prepared with a few simple tools, some seed and fertilizer, and a patriotic spirit. They farmed small plots of land to overcome food shortages. In small towns and large cities, any spare piece of land was likely to be used to grow food. Many victory gardens were small and humble, but the combined efforts of millions of Americans produced big results. In 1943 the nation’s 20 million victory gardens yielded an astounding 8 million tons of produce. However, victory gardens alone could not fulfill all of the nation’s food needs. Some foods could not be grown in home gardens. There were shortages of other products as well. As a result, the OPA set up a system for rationing, or establishing fixed allotments of goods deemed essential for the military. Under this system, households received ration books with coupons to be used for buying such scarce goods. These included meat, shoes, sugar, coffee, and gasoline. Most Americans willingly accepted rationing as a personal contribution to the war effort. Inevitably, some cheated by hoarding scarce goods or purchasing them through the “black market.” There, rationed items could be bought illegally without coupons at inflated prices. However, the penalties for breaking the rules could be severe. Some materials were so vital to the war effort that even rationing was not enough to preserve the country’s supply. To help fulfill the military’s needs—and to keep civilians from suffering too much—scientists developed synthetic versions of some of these products. For example, rubber was necessary for making tires and other automotive parts. Nearly all of the world’s rubber supply came from parts of Asia that had been conquered by Japan. American companies began to produce synthetic rubber for many of these uses. The synthetic fabric nylon was produced to replace silk in parachutes, protective gear, and other military applications.
### MOBILIZATION OF SCIENTISTS 
In 1941 Roosevelt created the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to bring scientists into the war effort. The OSRD stimulated improvements in semiconductor technology, which is vital for modern communications equipment. In turn, these advances led to the development of radar and sonar. These new technologies were used to locate submarines under water. Scientists with the OSRD also worked to improve weapons technology. For example, they developed new bombs and guided missiles. They also improved aircraft technology. The first combat jet aircraft were launched during World War II, although they were not actually used in fighting during the war. The OSRD also supported research into lifesaving medications and techniques. For example, it pushed the development of “miracle drugs,” such as penicillin. These drugs saved countless lives on and off the battlefield. It also funded research into new ways to isolate blood plasma—the liquid portion of blood—and transport both plasma and whole blood to where they were needed on the battlefield. The OSRD encouraged the use of pesticides like DDT to fight insects. As a result, U.S. soldiers were probably the first in history to be relatively free from body lice. The most significant achievement of the OSRD, however, was the secret development of a new weapon, the atomic bomb. Interest in such a weapon began in 1939, after German scientists succeeded in splitting uranium atoms. That process released an enormous amount of energy. This news prompted physicist and German refugee Albert Einstein to write a letter to President Roosevelt. Einstein warned that the Germans could use their discovery to build a weapon of enormous destructive power. Roosevelt responded by creating an Advisory Committee on Uranium to study the new discovery. In 1941 the committee reported that it would take from three to five years to build an atomic bomb. The OSRD hoped to shorten that time. It set up an intensive program in 1942 to develop a bomb as quickly as possible. Much of the early research was performed at Columbia University in Manhattan. As a result, the Manhattan Project became the code name for research work that was done across the country.
### TRANSPORTING GOODS 
All of the products made in American factories and saved by citizens had to be shipped to the soldiers overseas. Soldiers on both fronts needed weapons, food, medicines, and other supplies to be successful. Much of the responsibility for transporting goods to the war fronts fell to the U.S. merchant marine, a fleet of civilian merchant ships. More than 200,000 Americans served in the merchant marine during the war. With battles raging on two fronts, transporting goods presented a huge challenge. Any goods transported to either Europe or the Pacific front had to cross an ocean patrolled by enemy ships, submarines, and planes. For safety, most merchant ships traveled in convoys. These groups were often escorted by warships. Even with such precautions, however, merchant shipping was dangerous. Dozens of ships were sunk, and tens of thousands of sailors were killed. The nature of some products made them more challenging to ship. Many medicines and foods were perishable. They could not be shipped or stored without refrigeration, which often was not available. Fragile containers, such as glass jars, were difficult to transport without damage. However, American ingenuity provided solutions. Researchers developed methods to freeze-dry vital medical supplies, including penicillin and blood plasma. Dried supplies did not need refrigeration. They could also be transported in more durable containers, such as cans. Freeze-drying was also used later in the war to preserve food to ship to soldiers on both fronts.
## A Production Miracle 
One of the most important and most challenging aspects of mobilization was the rapid industrial change from peacetime to wartime production. Following the outbreak of war, the federal government spent tens of billions of dollars on weapons and supplies. Roosevelt set the ambitious goal of building 60,000 new planes in 1942 and 125,000 more the next year. He asked for 120,000 tanks in the same period. To meet these goals, Roosevelt relied on government agencies to regulate industry. They determined what factories produced, what prices they charged, and how raw materials would be allocated. He also relied on the efforts of millions of Americans who went to work in the nation’s factories, many for the first time.
### THE INDUSTRIAL RESPONSE
Early in February 1942, American newspapers reported the end of automobile production for private use. The last car to roll off an automaker’s assembly line was a gray sedan with “victory trim,”—that is, without chrome-plated parts. Within weeks of the shutdown in production, the nation’s automobile plants had been retooled. They began to produce tanks, planes, boats, and command cars. They were not alone. Across the nation, factories were quickly converted to war production. A maker of mechanical pencils produced bomb parts. A bedspread manufacturer made mosquito netting. A soft-drink company converted from filling bottles with liquid to filling shells with explosives. Meanwhile, shipyards and defense plants expanded with dizzying speed. By the end of 1942, industrialist Henry J. Kaiser had built seven massive new shipyards that turned out Liberty ships (cargo carriers), tankers, troop transports, and “baby” aircraft carriers at an astonishing rate. Late that year Kaiser invited reporters to Way One in his Richmond, California, shipyard. They watched as his workers assembled Hull 440, a Liberty ship, in a record-breaking four days. Before the end of the fourth day, 25,000 amazed spectators watched as Hull 440 slid into the water. How could such a ship be built so fast? Kaiser used prefabricated, or factory-made, parts that could be assembled quickly at his shipyards. Equally important were his workers, who worked at record speeds. 
### LABOR’S CONTRIBUTION
When the war began, defense contractors warned the Selective Service System that the nation did not have enough workers to meet both its military and its industrial needs. They were wrong. A wave of patriotism swept through the country, binding Americans together against a common enemy. Some Americans expressed their patriotic feelings by enlisting in the armed forces. Others rushed to take jobs in factories to support the war effort. By 1944, despite the draft, nearly 18 million workers were laboring in war industries, three times as many as in 1941. Swept up in the national wave of patriotism, laborers threw themselves fully into the war effort. Individuals willingly worked long hours with few breaks. Labor unions pledged not to strike or take any other action that would slow down production. As the war dragged on and prices climbed, however, some workers grew frustrated. They called on union leaders to fight for higher wages. To head off a potential production slowdown, Roosevelt established the National War Labor Board (NWLB) in 1942. The board served as a mediator between labor and management to prevent strikes. It prevented protests about wages by setting limits on wage increases, which took the decision out of management’s hands. To prevent union instability, which could affect production, it banned workers from quitting or changing unions while employed. 
### NEW WORKERS
Among those who committed to working in war industries were more than 6 million women who wanted to support their country. At first, war industries feared that most women lacked the necessary strength for factory work and were reluctant to hire them. But women proved that they could operate welding torches or riveting guns as well as men. After that, employers could not hire enough of them, especially since women earned only about 60 percent as much as men doing the same jobs. The character “Rosie the Riveter” was inspired by a popular song of the era. Her image was that of a strong woman hard at work in an arms factory. That image became an enduring symbol of these women and their contributions to the war. Defense plants also hired more than 2 million minority workers during the war years. These included African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and others. Like women, minorities faced strong prejudice at first. Before the war, 75 percent of defense contractors simply refused to hire African Americans. Another 15 percent employed them only in menial jobs. Nationalism and a desire to contribute led African American workers to take these menial jobs. However, many were not happy about the situation. “Negroes will be considered only as janitors,” declared the general manager of North American Aviation. “It is the company policy not to employ them as mechanics and aircraft workers.” Many of the new workers in America’s factories had previously worked on farms, as had many soldiers. The departure of so many workers from American farms led to a severe shortage of agricultural laborers. Faced with the possibility of low harvests, the U.S. government responded. In 1942 it launched a program in which Mexican braceros, or hired hands, were invited to the United States to work on farms. Hundreds of thousands of braceros entered the United States between 1942 and 1947. By the war’s end, many braceros had also taken jobs in the railroad industry. In theory, the bracero program guaranteed that all workers would receive fair pay and equal treatment under the law. In practice, however, many farm owners ignored these guidelines. Some shorted workers’ paychecks or gave them inadequate tools for their work. In addition, many braceros entering the country were met with scorn and abuse from other farm workers and from supervisors.
## Opportunity, Discrimination, and Adjustment 
The war opened up many opportunities for women and minorities. At the same time, though, old prejudices and policies persisted, both in the military and at home. In addition, Americans of all ethnicities and backgrounds had to adjust to the absence of loved ones fighting abroad.
### CONFRONTING LABOR ISSUES 
To protest discrimination both in the military and in industry, A. Philip Randolph organized a march on Washington. Randolph was president and founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and the nation’s most respected African American labor leader. He called on African Americans everywhere to come to the capital on July 1, 1941. They were to march under the banner “We Loyal Colored Americans Demand the Right to Work and Fight for Our Country.” President Roosevelt feared that the march might provoke white resentment or violence. He called Randolph to the White House and asked him to back down. “I’m sorry Mr. President,” the labor leader said, “the march cannot be called off.” Roosevelt then asked, “How many people do you plan to bring?” Randolph replied, “One hundred thousand, Mr. President.” Roosevelt was stunned. Even half that number of African American protesters would be far more than Washington—still a very segregated city—could feed, house, and transport. In the end it was Roosevelt, not Randolph, who backed down. In return for Randolph’s promise to cancel the march, the president issued an executive order creating the Fair Employment Practices Committee. It called on employers and labor unions “to provide for the full and equitable participation of all workers in defense industries, without discrimination because of race, creed, color, or national origin.” 
### CIVIL RIGHTS PROTESTS
African Americans made some progress on the home front. During the war, thousands of African Americans left the South. The majority moved to the Midwest where they could find better jobs. Between 1940 and 1944 the percentage of African Americans working in skilled or semiskilled jobs rose from 16 to 30 percent. Wherever African Americans moved, however, discrimination presented tough hurdles. In 1942 civil rights leader James Farmer founded an interracial organization called the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). Its purpose was to confront urban segregation in the North. That same year, CORE staged its first sit-in at a segregated Chicago restaurant. As African American migrants moved into already overcrowded cities, tensions rose. In 1943 a tidal wave of racial violence swept across the country. The worst conflict erupted in Detroit on a hot Sunday afternoon in June. It began as a disagreement between blacks and whites at a beach on the Detroit River. It grew into a riot when white sailors stationed nearby joined in. The fighting continued for three days. False rumors circulated that whites had murdered a black woman and her child and that black rioters had killed 17 whites. By the time President Roosevelt sent federal troops to restore order, 9 whites and 25 blacks lay dead or dying. The violence of 1943 showed both black and white Americans just how serious racial tensions had become in the United States. By 1945 more than 400 committees had been established by American communities to improve race relations. Progress was slow, but African Americans were determined not to give up the gains they had made. 
### TENSION IN LOS ANGELES
Mexican Americans also experienced prejudice during the war years. In the violent summer of 1943, Los Angeles exploded in anti-Mexican “zoot-suit” riots. The zoot suit was a style of dress adopted by Mexican American youths to symbolize their rebellion against tradition. It consisted of a long jacket and pleated pants. Broadbrimmed hats were often worn with the suits. The riots began when 11 sailors in Los Angeles reported that they had been attacked by zoot-suit-wearing Mexican Americans. This charge triggered violence involving thousands of servicemen and civilians. Mobs poured into Mexican neighborhoods and grabbed any zoot-suiters they could find. The attackers ripped off their victims’ clothes and beat them senseless. The riots lasted almost a week and resulted in the beatings of hundreds of Mexican American youth and other minorities. In spite of such unhappy experiences with racism, many Mexican Americans expressed hope that their sacrifices during wartime would lead to a better future. 
### HARDSHIPS FOR NATIVE AMERICANS
Native Americans, too, faced discrimination during the war. Native Americans on the whole were among the most enthusiastic volunteers for military service. Although they risked their lives to defend American values, many states still prohibited them from voting. Even in states that did not bar Native Americans from voting outright, local policies prevented many from casting ballots. During the war, the federal government reclaimed some reservation land for its own use. Some of this land was used to build or enlarge military bases or to create weapons-testing areas. Parts of two reservations in Arizona were designated as relocation camps, despite the objections of the residents. Huge tracts of Native American land were mined for valuable resources, including oil, gas, lead, and helium. During the war, these lands yielded more than $39 million worth of vital minerals. However, the Native American tribes on the lands received only $6 million in compensation. 
### SOCIAL ADJUSTMENTS
Americans willingly put up with many hardships and managed without comforts during the war. For many, the hardest part was dealing with the absence of loved ones. Across the country, families with loved ones in the armed forces showed their sacrifice by displaying a flag with a blue star. If the service member was killed, the blue star was replaced with a gold one. Over the course of the war, more than 400,000 American service members were killed, leaving many grieving families behind. Families adjusted to the changes brought on by war as best they could. With millions of fathers in the armed forces, mothers struggled to raise their children alone. Many young children got used to being left with neighbors or relatives or in child-care centers as more and more mothers went to work. Teenagers left at home without parents sometimes drifted into juvenile delinquency. And when fathers finally did come home, there was often a painful period of readjustment as family members got to know one another again. The war helped create new families, too. Longtime sweethearts—as well as couples who barely knew each other—rushed to marry before the soldier or sailor was shipped overseas. In booming towns like Seattle, the number of marriage licenses issued went up by as much as 300 percent early in the war. A New Yorker observed in 1943, “On Fridays and Saturdays, the City Hall area is blurred with running soldiers, sailors, and girls hunting the license bureau, floral shops, ministers, blood-testing laboratories, and the Legal Aid Society.”
## Internment of Japanese Americans 
While some minorities struggled with tension and discrimination, the war produced tragic result for others. After Pearl Harbor, government officials began to fear that people of German, Italian, and Japanese descent might resort to sabotage or other disloyal behavior in order to help the enemy. Italians and Germans who had immigrated to the United States but not yet completed the citizenship process were considered “enemy aliens.” Many were forced to register with the government and carry identification cards. In addition, the government designated certain areas restricted from enemy aliens. Such restrictions on people’s civil liberties placed a huge burden on those living or working in these areas. Thousands of Germans and Italians were placed in prison camps. But the worst treatment was reserved for the Japanese Americans. When the war began, 120,000 Japanese Americans lived in the United States, mostly on the West Coast. The sense of fear and uncertainty following Pearl Harbor caused a wave of prejudice against them. The surprise in Hawaii had stunned the nation. After the bombing, panic-stricken citizens feared that the Japanese would soon attack the United States. Frightened people believed false rumors that Japanese Americans were committing sabotage by mining coastal harbors and poisoning vegetables. Early in 1942 the War Department called for the mass evacuation of all Japanese Americans from Hawaii. General Delos Emmons, the military governor of Hawaii, resisted the order because 37 percent of the people in Hawaii were Japanese Americans. To remove them would have destroyed the islands’ economy and hindered U.S. military operations there. However, he was eventually forced to order the internment, or confinement, of 1,444 Japanese Americans, 1 percent of Hawaii’s Japanese American population. On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 requiring the removal of people of Japanese ancestry from California and parts of Washington, Oregon, and Arizona. Based on strong recommendations from the military, he justified this step as necessary for national security. In the following weeks, the army rounded up some 110,000 Japanese Americans. They were sent to ten hastily constructed remote “relocation centers,” euphemisms for prison camps. About two-thirds were Nisei, or Japanese people born in this country of parents who emigrated from Japan. Thousands of Nisei had already joined the armed forces. To Monica Itoi Sone, a Nisei teenager from Seattle, the evacuation to the Minidoka camp in Idaho seemed unbelievable. No specific charges were ever filed against Japanese Americans, and no evidence of subversion was ever found. Faced with expulsion, terrified families were forced to sell their homes, businesses, and all their belongings for less than their true value. Japanese Americans fought for justice, both in the courts and in Congress. The initial results were discouraging. In 1944 the Supreme Court decided, in Korematsu v. United States, that the government’s policy of evacuating Japanese Americans to camps was justified under the Constitution on the basis of “military necessity.” After the war, however, the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) pushed the government to compensate those sent to the camps for their lost property. In 1965 Congress authorized the spending of $38 million for that purpose. This amount represented less than a tenth of Japanese Americans’ actual losses. The JACL did not give up its quest for justice. In 1978 it called for the payment of reparations, or restitution, to each individual that suffered internment. A decade later Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed, a bill that promised $20,000 to every Japanese American sent to a relocation camp. When the checks were sent in 1990, a letter from President George Bush accompanied them, in which he stated, “We can never fully right the wrongs of the past. But we can take a clear stand for justice and recognize that serious injustices were done to Japanese Americans during World War II.”

# Extra Stuff
## The Poisonous Toadstool
This was an anti-semitic book that was taught to little german children. One of the stories was when Inge's mother sends her to a Jewish doctor, despite Inge's protests of what she learned in the League of German Girls. She goes to the doctor and she sees that the doctor molested another child and she runs away. This is an incredibly racist and horrible thing to drill into young children's head.
## Conditions leading to Hitler's rise to power
- German was demilitarized, they went from the number one power in the world to Switzerland having a stronger military, there is resentment and anger towards America and other European forces. 
- The treaty of Versailles caused hyper-inflation and blamed Germany for all of the problems of the war.
- The Nazi party was invited into power by conservatives, who thought they could use Hitler to fight German communists, they make him chancellor.
- Pastor Martin Niemoller was a german ww1 veteran who was a conservative frustated by treaty of versailles, initially supports hitler because nationalism then becomes a minister.
## Traits of Fascism
- Nationalism
Goes beyond pride in country, there are going to be conflicts with other countries
- Anti-Semitism
- Hostility towards Communism
- Negative looks at unions
linked to socialists/communists
- Central Allpowerful government
power is not spread out it is concentrated
- Oppression of opposition
will not tolerate criticism, control the media
- More government involvement
- Race/Nation over the individual
**Nazi Germany checks all of these boxes**
## Munich Putsch
Early, when Nazi party was relatively small, it was a coup against the government, they rised up and started in Munich and the plan was to march to the capital and violently overthrow the democratically elected government. Hitler was brought up on charges, he is defiant and he said that he would do it again. WHile in jail he writes Mein Kampf.
## Mein Kampf
It means my struggle, it talks about his plans about overthrowing the treaty of versailles to restoring Germany's greatness. Talks about Living Space, or Lebensraum.
## Some important people
- Herman Gorring
  - nazi fighter pilot
  - is a war hero
  - head of german air force under hitler
  - close confidant to hitler
- Albert Speer
  - called good german
  - architect, works for hitler
  - effective at his job
  - regretful after war
- Heinrich Himler
  - Most feared people in Nazi germany
  - Head of the SS
  - loyal to Hitler
- Joseph Goebbels
  - Minister of propaganda
  - Anti-semitism
## Nuremberg
Every year a rally was held there, and there was hundreds of thousands of party members there. Reinforces Hitler's fake idea that Germany was being restored. THere were things called Nurmeberg Laws and Aryanization passed in 1935, it puts into law Jewish inclusion in Germany. 
## Kristallnacht
Burned Jewish Synagogue, haoppened Novemeber 9th 1938, shows the violence behind the german society. Polish German Jew assassinates German Diplomat, Goebbels whips people into a frenzy, and Jewish places were burned and destroyed. German police and firefighters were told not to do anything. Several hundred Jews were killed during it and they were fined for the cleanup. 
## Washington Naval Conference
Internatioal agreement to remove background tensions that escalated the first world war. The ratio was 5(US):5(UK):3(France). Germany Italy and Japan didn't follow this rule. They limited the size(35000 tons) and firepower(16 in guns) of battleships. No country was supposed to increase their fortifications. People who had privileges with China respect their territorial and poliital integrity. 
## Kellog-Briand Pact
Starts with two countries, US and France, they are talking about outlawing war, by a year 30 years sign off on this. How do you enforce peace. What is war? It didn't ban defensive war. 
## Nye Commission
1934-36, after first world war there was alot of anti-war and isolationist sentiment. Pursuing the military industrial complex caused the american interference war. There was little evidence for this.
## Neutrality Acts
- 1935, Prohibits the export of arms and ammunitions from the US to countries in war. 
- 1937, US ships shouldn't go into war zone
- 1939, Pendulum swings back, countries can buy stuff but they have to pay in cash and have to come to america to pick it up
- Roosevelt gave a fireside chat talking aboput your neghibours house on fire and a garden hose.
- Americans knew that hitler was a athreat but they didn't want to actually help out
## Luftwaffe
1935, germany wasn't allowed an air force bcos of treaty of versailles but they still trained pilots using gliders and such. Concentrated on attacking, bombing, and the like.
## Heinz Guderian
Key figure in the innovation in the interwar period, restored mobility to the battlefield after ww1(trench warfare), they did surprise attacks and combined all elements of their military, Luftwaffe, tanks, etc.
## Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact
August 23rd 1939, Stalin and Germany's ambassador sign an agreement to not attack each other, or choose sides if they were in a conflict with one another. This is important because Germany was trying not to repeat what happened during World War I, where they had to fight a two front war, with the threat of russia gone, it increased Germany's chance of victory. 
## Invasion of Poland
Poland, 9/1/1939, Invasion of Polnd, the last straw on the camel's back, Engalnd decide this is it and declares world war 2 
## Maginot line
Freance after ww1, decided to make the defensive Maginot Line. Maginot Line works however Germany decides to seperate the British from the French.
## Blitzkrieg
Extreemely fast, in six weeks germany makes france surrender. Took over denmark in a day.
## Winston Churchill
replaces neville chamberlain, say "The battle of france is over...I expect that the Battle of Britain has just begun".
## Battle of Britain
Churchill inspired the british to not back down, Germany was hoping they would just give up, goes from 8/40 to 5/41. At first, they target aircraft factories, radar. Midway through, Hitler orders them to start aiming for civilians and it became a war of terror, at the end 43,000 civilians dead. 
## German invasion of Soviet Union/Operation Barbarossa
largest invasion in human history. Hitler gets frustrated with britain and decides to attack Soviet Union instead. Goes from the arctic to the black sea.
