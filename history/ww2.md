# War Breaks Out
## Failures of the Treaty of Versailles
The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, left many European nations dissatisfied. The treaty’s war-guilt clause placed the blame for the war solely on Germany. The treaty also demanded that the Germans pay reparations, or payments for damages and expenses caused by the war. The amount demanded far exceeded what the German government could actually afford to pay. Instead of securing a “just and secure peace,” the Treaty of Versailles caused anger and resentment. Germans saw nothing fair in a treaty that blamed them for starting the war. Nor did they find security in a settlement that stripped them of their overseas colonies and border territories. The terms of the treaty did serious damage to the German economy. It forced Germany to give up control of some of its major industrial regions, which made the reparations payments even more challenging. These factors helped bring about a period of severe inflation, or rising prices. Prices increased at such an incredible rate that by 1923, German currency had simply ceased to have any meaningful value. These problems overwhelmed the Weimar Republic, the democratic government set up in Germany after World War I. Italy was also unhappy with the treaty. The Italians had been on the winning side in the war. They had hoped to be rewarded with territory as part of the treaty. Instead, they were largely ignored during the peace talks. Similarly dissatisfied, the Soviets resented the carving up of parts of Russia. The peace settlement had not fulfilled President Wilson’s hope of a world “safe for democracy.” New democratic governments that emerged in Europe after the war floundered. Without a democratic tradition, people turned to authoritarian leaders to solve their economic and social problems. The new democracies collapsed, and dictators were able to seize power. Some had great ambitions.
## The Spread of Totalitarianism
The seeds of new conflicts had been sown in World War I. For many nations, peace had brought not prosperity but revolution fueled by economic depression and struggle. The postwar years also brought the rise of powerful dictators driven by the belief in nationalism—loyalty to one’s country above all else—and dreams of territorial expansion.
### JOSEPH STALIN TRANSFORMS THE SOVIET UNION
In Russia, hopes for democracy gave way to civil war, resulting in the establishment of a Communist state, officially called the Soviet Union, in 1922. After V. I. Lenin died in 1924, Joseph Stalin, whose last name means “man of steel,” took control of the country. Stalin focused on creating a model Communist state. In doing so, he made both agricultural and industrial growth the prime economic goals of the Soviet Union. Stalin abolished all privately owned farms and replaced them with collectives—large governmentowned farms, each worked by hundreds of families. Stalin moved to transform the Soviet Union from a backward rural nation into a great industrial power. In 1928 the Soviet dictator outlined the first of several “five-year plans” for industrialization. All economic activity was placed under state management. By 1937 the Soviet Union had become the world’s second-largest industrial power, surpassed in overall production only by the United States. The human costs of this transformation were enormous. In his drive to purge, or eliminate, anyone who threatened his power, Stalin did not spare even his most faithful supporters. While the final toll will never be known, historians estimate that Stalin was responsible for the deaths of 8 million to 13 million people. Millions more died in famines caused by the restructuring of Soviet society. By 1939 Stalin had firmly established a totalitarian government that tried to exert complete control over its citizens. In a totalitarian state, individuals have no rights, and the government suppresses all opposition.
### THE RISE OF FASCISM IN ITALY 
While Stalin was consolidating his power in the Soviet Union, Benito Mussolini was establishing a totalitarian regime in Italy, where unemployment and inflation produced bitter strikes. Some of those strikes were led by Communists. Alarmed by these threats, the middle and upper classes demanded stronger leadership. Mussolini took advantage of this situation. A powerful speaker, Mussolini knew how to appeal to Italy’s wounded national pride. He played on the fears of economic collapse and communism. “Italy wants peace, work, and calm. I will give these things with love if possible, with force if necessary,” he said. In this way, he won the support of many discontented Italians. By 1921 Mussolini had established the Fascist Party. Fascism (făshʹĭz´әm) stressed nationalism and placed the interests of the state above those of individuals. To strengthen the nation, Fascists argued, power must rest with a single strong leader and a small group of devoted party members. (The Latin fasces—a bundle of rods tied around an ax handle—had been a symbol of unity and authority in ancient Rome.) In October 1922 Mussolini marched on Rome with thousands of his followers, whose black uniforms gave them the name “Black Shirts.” When important government officials, the army, and the police sided with the Fascists, the Italian king appointed Mussolini head of the government. Calling himself Il Duce, or “the leader,” Mussolini gradually extended Fascist control to every aspect of Italian life. Tourists marveled that Il Duce had even “made the trains run on time.” Mussolini achieved this efficiency, however, by crushing all opposition and by making Italy a totalitarian state.
### THE NAZIS TAKE OVER GERMANY 
In Germany, Adolf Hitler had followed a path to power similar to Mussolini’s. At the end of World War I, Hitler had been a jobless soldier drifting around Germany. In 1919 he joined a struggling group called the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, better known as the Nazi Party. Despite its name, this party had no ties to socialism. Hitler proved to be such a powerful public speaker and organizer that he quickly became the party’s leader. Calling himself Der Führer—“the Leader”—he promised to bring Germany out of chaos. In his book Mein Kampf [My Struggle], Hitler set forth the basic beliefs of Nazism that became the plan of action for the Nazi Party. Nazism (nätʹsĭz´әm), the German brand of fascism, was based on extreme nationalism. Hitler, who had been born in Austria, dreamed of uniting all Germanspeaking people in a great German empire. Hitler also wanted to enforce racial “purification” at home. In his view, Germans—especially blue-eyed, blond-haired “Aryans”—formed a “master race” that was destined to rule the world. “Inferior races,” such as Jews, Slavs, and all nonwhites, were deemed fit only to serve the Aryans. A third element of Nazism was national expansion. Hitler believed that for Germany to thrive, it needed more lebensraum, or living space. One of the Nazis’ aims, as Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf, was “to secure for the German people the land and soil to which they are entitled on this earth,” even if this could be accomplished only by “the might of a victorious sword.” The Great Depression helped the Nazis come to power. Because of war debts and dependence on American loans and investments, Germany’s economy was hit hard. By 1932 some 6 million Germans were unemployed. Many men who were out of work joined Hitler’s private army, the “storm troopers” (or “Brown Shirts”). The German people were desperate and turned to Hitler as their last hope. By mid-1932, the Nazis had become the strongest political party in Germany. In January 1933 Hitler was appointed chancellor (prime minister). Once in power, Hitler quickly dismantled Germany’s democratic Weimar Republic. In its place he established the Third Reich, or Third German Empire. According to Hitler, the Third Reich would be a “Thousand-Year Reich”—it would last for a thousand years.
### MILITARISTS GAIN CONTROL IN JAPAN 
Halfway around the world, Japan was another country torn by political and economic conflict. Among the problems facing Japan was the limited size of its territory. The islands of Japan were growing crowded. At the time, Japan’s government was under civilian control. Many Japanese, however, were unhappy with their leaders. Dissatisfaction was especially high among members of the military who held strong nationalist beliefs. In the early 1930s a group of military leaders used violence to take control of the imperial government of Japan. Like Hitler and Mussolini, these leaders believed in the need for a strong army to accomplish their country’s goals, a philosophy known as militarism. Also like Hitler, they felt the need for more living space for a growing population. Many Japanese wanted to expand their territory and gain greater access to wealth and resources. This desire grew even stronger as a result of the worldwide economic depression of the 1930s.
### CIVIL WAR BREAKS OUT IN SPAIN 
In 1936 a group of Spanish army officers led by General Francisco Franco rebelled against the Spanish republic. Revolts broke out all over Spain, and the Spanish Civil War began. The war aroused passions not only in Spain but also throughout the world. About 3,000 Americans formed the Abraham Lincoln Battalion and traveled to Spain to fight against Franco. “We knew, we just knew,” recalled Martha Gellhorn, “that Spain was the place to stop fascism.” Such limited aid was not sufficient to stop the spread of fascism, however. The Western democracies remained neutral. Although the Soviet Union sent equipment and advisers, Hitler and Mussolini backed Franco’s forces with troops, weapons, tanks, and fighter planes. The war forged a close relationship between the German and Italian dictators, who signed a formal alliance known as the Rome-Berlin Axis. After a loss of almost 500,000 lives, Franco’s victory in 1939 established him as Spain’s fascist dictator. Once again a totalitarian government ruled in Europe
## Dictators Expand Their Territory 
Having established their totalitarian regimes, many dictators sought to increase their territories, often through military action. Unfortunately the League of Nations, which had been established after World War I to prevent such aggressive acts, did little to thwart their efforts.
### JAPAN’S AMBITIONS IN THE PACIFIC 
In 1931 the militarists in control of Japan’s government began working in earnest to achieve their goals of growing Japan’s territory and access to resources. Ignoring the protests of more moderate Japanese officials, they launched a surprise attack and seized control of the Chinese province of Manchuria. Within several months, Japanese troops controlled the entire province, a large region about twice the size of Texas that was rich in natural resources. This action was a significant test of the power of the League of Nations. The League sent representatives to Manchuria to investigate the situation. Their report condemned Japan, who in turn simply quit the League. Meanwhile, the success of the Manchurian invasion put the militarists firmly in control of Japan’s government. As Germany began to expand its territory in Europe, it opened new opportunities for Japanese expansionists. Already in control of Manchuria, in July 1937 Hideki Tojo (hēʹd-kē tōʹjō´), chief of staff of Japan’s Kwantung Army, launched an invasion farther into China. As French, Dutch, and British colonies lay unprotected in Asia, Japanese leaders leaped at the opportunity to unite East Asia under Japanese control by seizing the colonial lands.
### AGGRESSION IN EUROPE AND AFRICA 
The failure of the League of Nations to take action against Japan did not escape the notice of Europe’s dictators. In 1933 Hitler pulled Germany out of the League of Nations. In 1935 he began a military buildup in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. A year later he sent troops into the Rhineland, a German region bordering France and Belgium that was demilitarized as a result of the Treaty of Versailles. The League did nothing to stop Hitler. Meanwhile, Mussolini began building his new Roman Empire. His first target was Ethiopia, one of Africa’s few remaining independent countries. By the fall of 1935, tens of thousands of Italian soldiers stood ready to advance on Ethiopia. The League of Nations reacted with brave talk of “collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression.” When the invasion began, however, the League’s response was an ineffective economic boycott—little more than a slap on Italy’s wrist. By May 1936 Ethiopia had fallen. In desperation, Haile Selassie, the ousted Ethiopian emperor, appealed to the League for assistance. Nothing was done. “It is us today,” he told them. “It will be you tomorrow.”
### AUSTRIA AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA FALL 
On November 5, 1937, Hitler met secretly with his top military advisers. He boldly declared that to grow and prosper Germany needed the land of its neighbors. His plan was to absorb Austria and Czechoslovakia into the Third Reich. When one of his advisers protested that annexing those countries could provoke war, Hitler replied, “‘The German Question’ can be solved only by means of force, and this is never without risk.” Austria was Hitler’s first target. The Paris Peace Conference following World War I had created the relatively small nation of Austria out of what was left of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The majority of Austria’s 6 million people were Germans who favored unification with Germany. On March 12, 1938, German troops marched into Austria unopposed. A day later Germany announced that its Anschluss, or “union,” with Austria was complete. The United States and the rest of the world did nothing. Hitler then turned to Czechoslovakia. About 3 million German- speaking people lived in the western border regions of Czechoslovakia which were called the Sudetenland. The mountainous region formed Czechoslovakia’s main defense against German attack. Hitler wanted to annex Czechoslovakia to provide more living space for Germany as well as to control its important natural resources. Hitler charged that the Czechs were abusing the Sudeten Germans, and he began massing troops on the Czech border. The U.S. correspondent William Shirer, then stationed in Berlin, wrote in his diary: “The Nazi press [is] full of hysterical headlines. All lies. Some examples: ‘Women and Children Mowed Down by Czech Armored Cars,’ or ‘Bloody Regime—New Czech Murders of Germans.’” Early in the crisis, both France and Great Britain promised to protect Czechoslovakia. Then, just when war seemed inevitable, Hitler invited French premier Édouard Daladier and British prime minister Neville Chamberlain to meet with him in Munich. When they arrived, the führer declared that the annexation of the Sudetenland would be his “last territorial demand.” In their eagerness to avoid war, Daladier and Chamberlain chose to believe him. On September 30, 1938, they signed the Munich Agreement, which turned the Sudetenland over to Germany without a single shot being fired. Chamberlain returned home and proclaimed: “My friends, there has come back from Germany peace with honor. I believe it is peace in our time.” Chamberlain’s satisfaction was not shared by Winston Churchill, Chamberlain’s political rival in Great Britain. In Churchill’s view, by signing the Munich Agreement, Daladier and Chamberlain had adopted a shameful policy of appeasement—or giving up principles to pacify an aggressor. As Churchill bluntly put it, “Britain and France had to choose between war and dishonor. They chose dishonor. They will have war.” Nonetheless, the House of Commons approved Chamberlain’s policy toward Germany and Churchill responded with a warning
## The German Offensive 
As Churchill had warned, Hitler was not finished expanding the Third Reich. As dawn broke on March 15, 1939, German troops poured into what remained of Czechoslovakia. At nightfall Hitler gloated, “Czechoslovakia has ceased to exist.” After that, the German dictator turned his land-hungry gaze toward Germany’s eastern neighbor, Poland. 
### THE SOVIET UNION DECLARES NEUTRALITY 
Like Czechoslovakia, Poland had a sizable German-speaking population. In the spring of 1939, Hitler began his familiar routine, charging that Germans in Poland were mistreated by the Poles and needed his protection. Some people thought that this time Hitler must have been bluffing. After all, an attack on Poland might bring Germany into conflict with the Soviet Union, Poland’s eastern neighbor. At the same time, such an attack would most likely provoke a declaration of war from France and Britain—both of whom had promised military aid to Poland. The result would be a two-front war. Fighting on two fronts had exhausted Germany in World War I. Surely, many thought, Hitler would not be foolish enough to repeat that mistake. As tensions rose over Poland, Stalin surprised everyone when he signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler. Once bitter enemies, on August 23, 1939, fascist Germany and Communist Russia now committed never to attack each other. Germany and the Soviet Union also signed a second, secret pact, agreeing to divide Poland between them. With the danger of a two-front war eliminated, the fate of Poland was sealed.
### BLITZKRIEG IN POLAND 
As day broke on September 1, 1939, the German Luftwaffe, or German air force, roared over Poland, raining bombs on military bases, airfields, railroads, and cities. At the same time, German tanks raced across the Polish countryside, spreading terror and confusion. This invasion was the initial test of Germany’s newest military strategy, the blitzkrieg, or lightning war. Blitzkrieg made use of advances in military technology—such as fast tanks that had been adapted to move quickly over rough terrain and more powerful aircraft that could travel over longer distances—to take the enemy by surprise and then quickly crush all opposition with overwhelming force. On September 3, two days following the terror in Poland, Britain and France declared war on Germany. The blitzkrieg tactics worked perfectly. Major fighting was over in three weeks, long before France, Britain, and their allies could mount a defense. In the last week of fighting, the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east, grabbing some of its territory. The portion Germany annexed in western Poland contained almost two-thirds of Poland’s population. By the end of the month, Poland had ceased to exist—and World War II had begun.
### THE PHONY WAR 
For several months after the fall of Poland, French and British troops on the Maginot Line, a system of fortifications built along France’s eastern border, sat staring into Germany, waiting for something to happen. On the Siegfried Line a few miles away German troops stared back. The blitzkrieg had given way to what the Germans called the sitzkrieg (“sitting war”), and what some newspapers referred to as the phony war. After occupying eastern Poland, Stalin began annexing the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Late in 1939 Stalin sent his Soviet army into Finland. After three months of fighting, the outnumbered Finns surrendered. Suddenly, on April 9, 1940, Hitler launched a surprise invasion of Denmark and Norway in order “to protect [those countries’] freedom and independence.” But in truth, Hitler planned to build bases along the coasts to strike at Great Britain. Next, Hitler turned against the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, which were overrun by the end of May. The phony war had ended. 
### THE FALL OF FRANCE 
France’s Maginot Line proved to be ineffective; the German army threatened to bypass the line during its invasion of Belgium. Hitler’s generals sent their tanks through the Ardennes, a region of wooded ravines in northeast France, thereby avoiding British and French troops who thought the Ardennes were impassable. The Germans continued to march toward Paris. The German offensive trapped almost 400,000 British and French soldiers as they fled to the beaches of Dunkirk on the French side of the English Channel. In less than a week, a makeshift fleet of fishing trawlers, tug boats, river barges, and pleasure craft—more than 800 vessels in all—ferried about 330,000 British, French, and Belgian troops to safety across the Channel. A few days later Italy entered the war on the side of Germany and invaded France from the south as the Germans closed in on Paris from the north. On June 22, 1940, at Compiègne, as William Shirer and the rest of the world watched, Hitler handed French officers his terms of surrender. Germans would occupy the northern part of France, and a Nazi-controlled puppet government, headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain, would be set up at Vichy in southern France. After France fell, a French general named Charles de Gaulle fled to England, where he set up a government-in-exile. De Gaulle proclaimed defiantly, “France has lost a battle, but France has not lost the war.”
### THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN 
In the summer of 1940, the Germans began to assemble an invasion fleet along the French coast. Because its naval power could not compete with that of Britain, Germany also launched an air war at the same time. The Luftwaffe began making bombing runs over Britain. Its goal was to gain total control of the skies by destroying Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF). Hitler had 2,600 planes at his disposal. On a single day—August 15—approximately 2,000 German planes ranged over Britain. Bombers pounded London every night for two solid months. The Battle of Britain raged on through the summer and fall. Night after night, German planes pounded British targets. At first the Luftwaffe concentrated on airfields and aircraft. Next it targeted cities. The RAF fought back brilliantly. With the help of a new technological device called radar, British pilots accurately plotted the flight paths of German planes, even in darkness. On September 15, 1940 the RAF shot down over 185 German planes; at the same time, they lost only 26 aircraft. Six weeks later Hitler called off the invasion of Britain indefinitely. “Never in the field of human conflict,” said Churchill in praise of the RAF pilots, “was so much owed by so many to so few.” Still, German bombers continued to pound Britain’s cities trying to disrupt production and break civilian morale. Even late in the war, when the Luftwaffe had been weakened and no longer had enough planes to send to Britain, the bombing continued. German scientists developed two types of rockets, the V-1 and the V-2, that could rain devastation on British cities from launch sites on the European mainland. At the same time, British pilots also bombed German cities. Civilians in both countries unrelentingly carried on.
# Holocaust
## The Persecution Begins 
On April 7, 1933, shortly after Hitler took power in Germany, he ordered all “non-Aryans” to be removed from government jobs. This order was one of the first moves in a campaign for racial purity. That campaign eventually led to the Holocaust, the systematic murder of 6 million Jews across Europe. The Nazis also murdered 5 million other people. 
### JEWS TARGETED 
Although Jews were not the only victims of the Holocaust, they were the main Nazi targets. Anti-Semitism, or hatred of the Jews, had a long history in parts of Europe. For decades many Germans had been looking for a scapegoat. They blamed the Jews as the cause of their failures. Adolf Hitler rose to power in part by promising to return Germany to its former glory. Hitler found that a majority of Germans were willing to support his belief that Jews were responsible for Germany’s economic problems and defeat in World War I. He also told the Germans that they came from a superior race, the Aryans, an idea that was found in German music and folktales. Hitler effectively used this notion to build support for his plans. As the Nazis tightened their hold on Germany, their persecution of the Jews increased. In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws stripped Jews of their German citizenship, jobs, and property. Jews had to wear a bright yellow Star of David attached to their clothing to make it easier for the Nazis to identify them. Worse things were yet to come. 
### KRISTALLNACHT 
November 9–10, 1938, became known as Kristallnacht (krĭsʹtälʹnächt´), or “Night of Broken Glass.” Nazi storm troopers attacked Jewish homes, businesses, and synagogues across Germany, Austria, and the recently occupied Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. The Nazis claimed the attacks were a spontaneous reaction to the assassination of a Nazi official by a Jewish teenager. In fact, Nazi officials encouraged the violence. During the rampage, thousands of Jewish businesses and places of worship were damaged or destroyed. An American who witnessed the violence wrote, “Jewish shop windows by the hundreds were systematically and wantonly smashed. . . . The main streets of the city were a positive litter of shattered plate glass.” Around 100 Jews were killed, and hundreds more were injured. Some 30,000 Jews were arrested. Afterward, the Nazis blamed the Jews for the destruction and held them financially responsible. Jews were fined a total of 1 billion marks.
### A FLOOD OF JEWISH REFUGEES 
Kristallnacht marked an increase in the Nazis’ Jewish persecution and sent a clear message to those Jews still in Germany. Over 100,000 managed to leave in the months following the attacks. However, many had trouble finding countries that would accept them. Nazi laws had left many German Jews without money or property, and most countries were unwilling to take in poor immigrants. France already had 40,000 Jewish refugees and did not want more. The British worried about fueling anti-Semitism. They refused to admit more than 80,000 Jewish refugees. The British also controlled the Palestine Mandate, part of which later became Israel. They did allow 30,000 refugees to settle there. Late in 1938 Germany’s foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, observed, “We all want to get rid of our Jews. The difficulty is that no country wishes to receive them.” Although the average Jew had little chance of reaching the United States, “persons of exceptional merit” were allowed in. Physicist Albert Einstein, author Thomas Mann, architect Walter Gropius, and theologian Paul Tillich were among 100,000 refugees the United States accepted. Many Americans wanted the door closed. Americans were concerned that letting in more refugees during the Great Depression would deny jobs to U.S. citizens. They also thought it would threaten economic recovery. Among Americans, there was widespread anti-Semitism and fear that “enemy agents” would enter the country. President Roosevelt said that he sympathized with the Jews. But he also said that he would not “do anything which would conceivably hurt the future of present American citizens.” 
### THE PLIGHT OF THE ST. LOUIS 
Official indifference to the situation of Germany’s Jews was clear in the case of the ship St. Louis. This German ocean liner passed Miami, Florida, in 1939. Although 740 of the liner’s 943 passengers had U.S. immigration papers, the Coast Guard followed the ship to prevent anyone from getting off in America. The ship was forced to return to Europe. “The cruise of the St. Louis,” wrote the New York Times, “cries to high heaven of man’s inhumanity to man.” Passenger Liane ReifLehrer recalls her childhood experiences. “My mother and brother and I were among the passengers who survived. . . . We were sent back to Europe and given haven in France, only to find the Nazis on our doorstep again a few months later.”  More than half of the passengers were later killed in the Holocaust.
## Hitler’s “Final Solution”
By 1939 only about a quarter million Jews remained in Germany. But other nations that Hitler occupied had millions more. Obsessed with a desire to rid Europe of its Jews, Hitler imposed what he called the “Final Solution”—a policy of genocide, the deliberate and systematic killing of an entire population.
### THE CONDEMNED 
Hitler’s Final Solution rested on the belief that Aryans were a superior people and that the strength and purity of this “master race” must be preserved. To accomplish this, the Nazis condemned the Jews to slavery and death. They did the same to other groups that they viewed as inferior or unworthy or as “enemies of the state.” After taking power in 1933, the Nazis had concentrated on silencing their political opponents: communists, socialists, liberals, and anyone else who spoke out against the government. Once the Nazis had eliminated these enemies, they turned against other groups in Germany. In addition to Jews, these groups included the following: 
- Gypsies—whom the Nazis believed to be an “inferior race” 
- Freemasons—whom the Nazis charged as supporters of the “Jewish conspiracy” to rule the world 
- Jehovah’s Witnesses—who refused to join the army or salute Hitler 

The Nazis also targeted other Germans whom they found unfit to be part of the “master race.” Such victims included homosexuals, the mentally deficient, the mentally ill, the physically disabled, and the incurably ill. Hitler began implementing his Final Solution in Poland with special Nazi death squads. Hitler’s elite Nazi “security squadrons” (or SS), rounded up Jewish men, women, children, and babies, and shot them on the spot.
### FORCED RELOCATION 
Jews also were ordered into dismal, overcrowded ghettos, segregated Jewish areas in certain Polish cities. The Nazis sealed off the ghettos with barbed wire and stone walls. Those Jews who tried to leave were shot. Life inside the ghetto was miserable. Food was scarce. Diseases spread quickly in the cramped conditions, and many Jews fell ill. The bodies of victims of the death squads piled up in the streets faster than they could be removed. Factories were built alongside ghettos where people were forced to work for German industry. In spite of the impossible living conditions, the Jews hung on. While some formed resistance movements inside the ghettos, others resisted by other means. They published and distributed underground newspapers. Secret schools were set up to educate Jewish children. Even theater and music groups continued to operate.
### CONCENTRATION CAMPS 
Finally, Jews in communities not reached by the killing squads were dragged from their homes and herded onto trains or trucks for shipment to concentration camps, or labor camps. Families were often separated, sometimes—like the Weissmanns—forever. Nazi concentration camps were originally set up to imprison political opponents and protesters. The camps were later turned over to the SS, who expanded the concentration camps and used them to warehouse other “undesirables.” Life in the camps was a cycle of hunger, humiliation, and work that almost always ended in death. The prisoners were crammed into crude wooden barracks that held up to a thousand people each. They shared their crowded quarters, as well as their meager meals, with hordes of rats and fleas. One survivor remembered such intense hunger “that if a bit of soup spilled over, prisoners would converge on the spot, dig their spoons into the mud and stuff the mess into their mouths.” Inmates in the camps worked from dawn to dusk, seven days a week, until they collapsed. Those too weak to work were killed.
## The Final Stage 
The Final Solution reached its final stage in early 1942. Hitler called his top officials to a meeting held in Wannsee, a suburb near Berlin. There they agreed to a new phase of the mass murder of Jews. Nazis already were using mass slaughter and starvation. Now they would add murder by poison gas. 
### MASS EXTERMINATIONS 
Overwork, starvation, beatings, and bullets did not kill fast enough to satisfy the Nazis. The Germans built six death camps in Poland. The first, Chelmno, began operating in 1941—before the meeting at Wannsee. Each camp had several huge gas chambers. As many as 12,000 people a day could be killed in them. Auschwitz was the largest of the death camps. When prisoners arrived there, they had to walk past several SS doctors. The doctors separated those strong enough to work from those who would die that day. Both groups had to leave all their belongings behind, supposedly to be returned to them later. Those assigned to die were taken to a room outside the gas chamber. They were told to undress for a shower and were even given pieces of soap. Finally, they were led into the chamber and poisoned with cyanide gas that came out of vents in the walls. Sometimes an orchestra of camp inmates played cheerful music during the killings. Those inmates had been temporarily spared from death because of their musical abilities. At first the bodies were buried in huge pits. At Belzec, Rudolf Reder was part of a 500-man death brigade that worked all day, he said, “either at grave digging or emptying the gas chambers.” But the decaying corpses gave off an odor that could be smelled for miles around. Worse yet, mass graves left evidence of the mass murder. At some camps, Nazis tried to cover up the evidence of their slaughter. They installed huge crematoriums, or ovens, in which to burn the dead. At other camps, the bodies were simply thrown into a pit and set on fire. Gassing was not the only method of extermination used in the camps. Prisoners were also shot, hanged, or injected with poison. Others died from horrible medical experiments done by camp doctors. Some of these victims were injected with deadly germs. The SS doctors wanted to study the effect of disease on different groups of people. Many more inmates were used to test methods of sterilization. Some Nazi doctors were interested in this as a possible way to improve the “master race.”
### THE GLOBAL RESPONSE 
In the United States, news of the Nazi violence against European Jews was not always noticeably reported. Anti-Jewish violence increased from 1939 to 1941. After that, some newspapers carried stories about German shooting operations in Poland and the Soviet Union. However, the victims’ ethnic background was not always identified. Also, the fate of Europe’s Jews was just one of many issues of concern to the United States. The war was the main focus of many countries’ attention. By 1942 the world began to become aware of the horrifying details of Hitler’s Final Solution. That year, one escapee from a concentration camp, Jacob Grojanowski, published a report of his experiences in the camp. From Poland, the report made its way to London and then to other parts of Europe. Also in 1942, Gerhart Riegner, the head of a major Jewish organization in Switzerland, sent a report to the U.S. State Department about the atrocities occurring in Europe. Those who read these reports or heard them described on the radio were horrified by their contents. Leaders of the Allied nations publicly condemned the Nazis for their disgraceful actions. The response to the Holocaust varied by nation and by individual. Some risked their own lives to save Jews from the Nazis. In 1942 King Christian X rejected the Nazis’ demand to enforce the Nuremberg Laws against the Jews in German-occupied Denmark. Almost all of Denmark’s Jews were rescued by being taken to Sweden in boats. Aristides de Sousa Mendes, a Portuguese diplomat stationed in France, defied his government’s orders to deny entry to Jewish refugees. Instead he issued some 10,000 visas to Jews seeking to enter Portugal. The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg issued “protective passports” that allowed thousands of Hungarian Jews to escape the Nazi death camps. Even citizens of Germany lent a hand. And Sempo Sugihara, Japanese consul in Lithuania, helped over 6,000 Jews to escape the Nazis’ clutches, an act that cost him his career. The United States did not immediately take steps to protect Europe’s Jewish population. Many observers have criticized that inaction. In part, the U.S. government was unsure how to arrange rescue operations in Europe. It was also unsure of what the outcome of those operations would be. It was not until January 1944 that President Roosevelt announced the creation of the War Refugee Board. The task of this organization was to rescue thousands of Jews in Hungary, Romania, and other parts of Europe. Those Jews might otherwise have fallen into the hands of the Nazis. In the spring of 1944, some Jewish organizations received detailed reports about the mass murders by gassing happening at Auschwitz. Those organizations proposed bombing the camp. The U.S. War Department refused, uncertain of the results. Theyexplained that they were not able to carry out a bombing raid with enough accuracy. They also argued that the best way to help the Jews was to end the war as quickly as possible. The War Department believed its focus should be exclusively on military targets.
### THE SURVIVORS 
An estimated six million Jews died in the death camps and in the Nazi massacres. But some miraculously escaped the worst of the Holocaust. Many had help from ordinary people who were appalled by the Nazis’ treatment of Jews. Some Jews even managed to survive the horrors of the concentration camps. In Gerda Weissmann Klein’s view, survival depended as much on one’s spirit as on getting enough to eat. “I do believe that if you were blessed with imagination, you could work through it,” she wrote. “If, unfortunately, you were a person that faced reality, I think you didn’t have much of a chance.” Those who did come out of the camps alive were forever changed by what they had witnessed. For survivor Elie Wiesel, who entered Auschwitz at the age of 15, the sun had set forever. Although he survived his ordeal, Wiesel’s experiences in Auschwitz irrevocably altered his worldview. After his liberation in 1945, Wiesel moved to France where he studied and became a journalist. He first recorded memoirs of his time in Auschwitz in Yiddish in 1956. The work, which was published as Night in 1960, has become known as one of the great pieces of Holocaust literature. Wiesel became a noted lecturer about the Holocaust. His work condemning violence, hatred, and oppression brought him worldwide fame, and in 1986 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.


# Extra Stuff
## The Poisonous Toadstool
This was an anti-semitic book that was taught to little german children. One of the stories was when Inge's mother sends her to a Jewish doctor, despite Inge's protests of what she learned in the League of German Girls. She goes to the doctor and she sees that the doctor molested another child and she runs away. This is an incredibly racist and horrible thing to drill into young children's head.
## Conditions leading to Hitler's rise to power
German was demilitarized, they went from the number one power in the world to Switzerland having a stronger military, there is resentment and anger towards America and other European forces. The treaty of Versailles caused hyper-inflation and blamed Germany for all of the problems of the war.
