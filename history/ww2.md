## The Poisonous Toadstool
This was an anti-semitic book that was taught to little german children. One of the stories was when Inge's mother sends her to a Jewish doctor, despite Inge's protests of what she learned in the League of German Girls. She goes to the doctor and she sees that the doctor molested another child and she runs away. This is an incredibly racist and horrible thing to drill into young children's head.
## Conditions leading to Hitler's rise to power
German was demilitarized, they went from the number one power in the world to Switzerland having a stronger military, there is resentment and anger towards America and other European forces. The treaty of Versailles caused hyper-inflation and blamed Germany for all of the problems of the war.
