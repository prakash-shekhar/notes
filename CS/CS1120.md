# Dictionaries, Sets, and Serializing Objects
## Dictionaries
- Object that stores a collection of data
- Each element consists of a key and value
  - Refered to as mapping of key to value
  - Key must be an immutable object (can't be list, set, or dict)
- To retrieve a specific value, use the key associated with it
- Format for creating dictionary:
```python
dictionary = {key1:val1, key2:val2}
```
## Retrieving values
- Elements in dictionary are unsorted
- General format for retrieving value from dictionary:
```python
return dictionary[key1] #returns val1
```
- If key in the dictionary, associated value is returned, otherwise, KeyError exception is raised
```python
return dictionary[key3] #KeyError is raised
```
- Use ```in``` and ```not in``` to test whether value is in dictionary, and prevent KeyError from being raised
## Adding Elements to an Existing Dictionary
- Dictionaries are mutable objects 
- To add a new key-value pair:
```python
dictionary[key3] = value3
```
- If key exists in the dictionary, the value associated with it will be changed 
```python
dictionary[key3] = 0
```
## Deleting Elements From an Existing Dictionary
- To delete a key-value pair:
```python
del dictionary[key3]
```
- If key is not in the dictionary, KeyError exception is raised
## Getting the Number of Elements and Mixing Data Types
- len function: used to obtain number of elements in dictionary
- Keys must be immutable objects, but associated values can be any type of object
  - One dictionary can include keys of several different immutable types
- Values stored in a single dictionary can be of different types
```python
key1 = 'Hello'
key2 = 34
key3 = (1, 4, 'Bye')
val1 = [1, 2, 3]
val2 = '34'
val3 = {'Hi':'Bye'}
dictionary = {key1:val1, key2:val2, key3"val3} #Notice keys are immutable, but values can be whatever type they want
```
## Dictionary Methods
|method name|what it does|
|---|---|
|clear|Clears the contents of a dictionary|
|get|Gets a value associated with specified key from the dictionary|
|items|returns all the dictionaries keys and associated values |
|keys|returns all the dictionaries keys as a sequence|
|pop|returns value associated with specified key and removes that key-value pair from the dictionary|
|popitem|returns a randomly selected key-value pair and removes that key-value pair from the dictionary|
|values|returns all the dictionaries values as a sequence|
## Sets
- object that stores a collection of data in same way as mathematical set
- All items must be unique 
- Set is unordered 
- Elements can be of different data types 
## Creating a Set
- For empty set, call ```set()```
- For non-empty set, call ```set(argument)``` where ```argument``` is an object that contains iterable elements
  - argument can be a list, string, or tuple
  - If argument is a string, each character becomes a set element 
  - If argument contains duplicates, only one of the duplicates will appear in the set 
## Getting the Number of and Adding Elements
- len function: returns the number of elements in the set 
- Sets are mutable objects 
- add method: adds an element to a set 
- update method: adds a group of elements to a set 
  - Argument must be a sequence containing  iterable elements, and each of the elements is added to the set 
## Deleting Elements From a Set
- remove and discard methods: remove the specified item from the set 
- The item that should be removed is passed to both methods as an argument 
- Behave differently when the specified item is not found in the set 
  - remove method raises a KeyError exception 
  - discard method does not raise an exception 
- clear method: clears all the elements of the set 
## Finding the Union of Sets
- A set that contains all the elements of both sets 
- To find the union of two sets: 
  - Use the union method  
    ```set1.union(set2)```
  - Use the | operator  
    ```Format: set1 | set2```
  - Both techniques return a new set which contains the union of both sets 
## Finding the Intersection of Sets
- A set that contains only the elements found in both sets 
- To find the intersection of two sets: 
  - Use the intersection method  
    ```set1.intersection(set2)```
  - Use the & operator  
    ```Format: set1 & set2```
  - Both techniques return a new set which contains the intersection of both sets 
## Finding the Difference of Sets
- A set that contains the elements that appear in the first set but do not appear in the second set 
- To find the difference of two sets: 
  - Use the difference method  
    ```set1.difference(set2)```
  - Use the - operator  
    ```Format: set1 - set2```
  - Both techniques return a new set which contains the difference of both sets 
## Finding the Symmetric Difference of Sets
- A set that contains the elements that are not shared by the two sets 
- To find the symmetric difference of two sets: 
  - Use the symmetric_difference method  
    ```set1.symmetric_difference(set2)```
  - Use the ^ operator  
    ```Format: set1 ^ set2```
  - Both techniques return a new set which contains the symmetric difference of both sets 
## Finding Subsets and Supersets
- Set A is subset of set B if all the elements in set A are included in set B 
- To determine whether set A is subset of set B 
  - Use the issubset method
  ```Format: setA.issubset(setB)```
  - Use the <= operator
  ```Format: setA <= setB```
- Set A is superset of set B if it contains all the elements of set B 
- To determine whether set A is superset of set B 
  - Use the issuperset method
  ```Format: setA.issuperset(setB)```
  - Use the >= operator
  ```Format: setA >= setB```
## Serializing Objects
- Serialize an object: convert the object to a stream of bytes that can easily be stored in a file  
- Pickling: serializing an object 
- To pickle an object: 
  - Import the pickle module 
  - Open a file for binary writing 
  - Call the pickle.dump function 
  ```Format: pickle.dump(object, file)``` 
  - Close the file 
- You can pickle multiple objects to one file prior to closing the file
- Unpickling: retrieving pickled object 
  - To unpickle an object: 
  - Import the pickle module 
  - Open a file for binary writing 
  - Call the pickle.load function 
  ```Format: pickle.load(file)``` 
  - Close the file 
- You can unpickle many objects from a file
# Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
## Procedural Programming
- Writing programs made of functions that perform specific tasks 
- Procedures typically operate on data items that are separate from the procedures 
- Data items commonly passed from one procedure to another 
- Focus: to create procedures that operate on the program’s data 
## Object-Oriented Programming
- Focused on creating objects
- Object: entity that contains data and procedures 
  - Data is known as data attributes and procedures are known as methods 
  - Methods perform operations on the data attributes
- Encapsulation: combining data and code into a single object 
- Data hiding: object’s data attributes are hidden from code outside the object 
  - Access restricted to only the object’s methods 
  - Protects from accidental corruption 
  - Outside code does not need to know internal structure of the object 
- Object reusability: the same object can be used in different programs  
  - Example: 3D image object can be used for architecture and game programming 
## An Everyday Example of an Object
- Data attributes: define the state of an object 
  - Example: clock object would have second, minute, and hour data attributes 
- Public methods: allow external code to manipulate the object 
  - Example: set_time, set_alarm_time 
- Private methods: used for object’s inner workings 
## Classes
- Class: code that specifies the data attributes and methods of a particular type of object 
  - Similar to a blueprint of a house or a cookie cutter 
- Instance: an object created from a class 
  - Similar to a specific house built according to the blueprint or a specific cookie 
  - There can be many instances of one class 
## Class Definitions
- Set of statements that define a class’s methods and data attributes 
```python
class Class_name:
```
- Method definition like any other python function definition
- self parameter: required in every method in the class – references the specific object that the method is working on
- Initializer method: automatically executed when an instance of the class is created
  - Initializes object’s data attributes and assigns self parameter to the object that was just created
  ```python
  def __init__ (self):
  ```
- To create a new instance of a class call the initializer method
```python3
My_instance = Class_Name()
```
- To call any of the class methods using the created instance, use dot notation
```python3
My_instance.method()
```
## Hiding Attributes and Storing Classes in Modules
- An object's data attributes should be private
  - To do this put two underscores (\__current_minute)
- Classes can be stored in modules
  - Filename for module must end in .py
  - Module can be imported to programs that use the class
## Accessor and Mutator Methods
- Typically, all of a class’s data attributes are private and provide methods to access and change them
- Accessor methods: return a value from a class’s attribute without changing it
  - Safe way for code outside the class to retrieve the value of attributes
- Mutator methods: store or change the value of a data attribute
## Passing Objects as Arguments
- Methods and functions often need to accept objects as arguments
- When you pass an object as an argument, you are actually passing a reference to the object
  - The receiving method or function has access to the actual object
