# Dictionaries, Sets, and Serializing Objects
## Dictionaries
- Object that stores a collection of data
- Each element consists of a key and value
  - Refered to as mapping of key to value
  - Key must be an immutable object (can't be list, set, or dict)
- To retrieve a specific value, use the key associated with it
- Format for creating dictionary:
```python
dictionary = {key1:val1, key2:val2}
```
## Retrieving values
- Elements in dictionary are unsorted
- General format for retrieving value from dictionary:
```python
return dictionary[key1] #returns val1
```
- If key in the dictionary, associated value is returned, otherwise, KeyError exception is raised
```python
return dictionary[key3] #KeyError is raised
```
- Use ```in``` and ```not in``` to test whether value is in dictionary, and prevent KeyError from being raised
## Adding Elements to an Existing Dictionary
- Dictionaries are mutable objects 
- To add a new key-value pair:
```python
dictionary[key3] = value3
```
- If key exists in the dictionary, the value associated with it will be changed 
```python
dictionary[key3] = 0
```
## Deleting Elements From an Existing Dictionary
- To delete a key-value pair:
```python
del dictionary[key3]
```
- If key is not in the dictionary, KeyError exception is raised
## Getting the Number of Elements and Mixing Data Types
- len function: used to obtain number of elements in dictionary
- Keys must be immutable objects, but associated values can be any type of object
  - One dictionary can include keys of several different immutable types
- Values stored in a single dictionary can be of different types
```python
key1 = 'Hello'
key2 = 34
key3 = (1, 4, 'Bye')
val1 = [1, 2, 3]
val2 = '34'
val3 = {'Hi':'Bye'}
dictionary = {key1:val1, key2:val2, key3"val3} #Notice keys are immutable, but values can be whatever type they want
```
## Dictionary Methods
|method name|what it does|
|---|---|
|clear|Clears the contents of a dictionary|
|get|Gets a value associated with specified key from the dictionary|
|items|returns all the dictionaries keys and associated values |
|keys|returns all the dictionaries keys as a sequence|
|pop|returns value associated with specified key and removes that key-value pair from the dictionary|
|popitem|returns a randomly selected key-value pair and removes that key-value pair from the dictionary|
|values|returns all the dictionaries values as a sequence|
## Sets
- object that stores a collection of data in same way as mathematical set
- All items must be unique 
- Set is unordered 
- Elements can be of different data types 
## Creating a Set
- For empty set, call ```set()```
- For non-empty set, call ```set(argument)``` where ```argument``` is an object that contains iterable elements
  - argument can be a list, string, or tuple
  - If argument is a string, each character becomes a set element 
  - If argument contains duplicates, only one of the duplicates will appear in the set 
## Getting the Number of and Adding Elements
- len function: returns the number of elements in the set 
- Sets are mutable objects 
- add method: adds an element to a set 
- update method: adds a group of elements to a set 
  - Argument must be a sequence containing  iterable elements, and each of the elements is added to the set 
## Deleting Elements From a Set
- remove and discard methods: remove the specified item from the set 
- The item that should be removed is passed to both methods as an argument 
- Behave differently when the specified item is not found in the set 
  - remove method raises a KeyError exception 
  - discard method does not raise an exception 
- clear method: clears all the elements of the set 
## Finding the Union of Sets
- A set that contains all the elements of both sets 
- To find the union of two sets: 
  - Use the union method  
    ```set1.union(set2)```
  - Use the | operator  
    ```Format: set1 | set2```
  - Both techniques return a new set which contains the union of both sets 
## Finding the Intersection of Sets
- A set that contains only the elements found in both sets 
- To find the intersection of two sets: 
  - Use the intersection method  
    ```set1.intersection(set2)```
  - Use the & operator  
    ```Format: set1 & set2```
  - Both techniques return a new set which contains the intersection of both sets 
## Finding the Difference of Sets
- A set that contains the elements that appear in the first set but do not appear in the second set 
- To find the difference of two sets: 
  - Use the difference method  
    ```set1.difference(set2)```
  - Use the - operator  
    ```Format: set1 - set2```
  - Both techniques return a new set which contains the difference of both sets 
## Finding the Symmetric Difference of Sets
- A set that contains the elements that are not shared by the two sets 
- To find the symmetric difference of two sets: 
  - Use the symmetric_difference method  
    ```set1.symmetric_difference(set2)```
  - Use the ^ operator  
    ```Format: set1 ^ set2```
  - Both techniques return a new set which contains the symmetric difference of both sets 
## Finding Subsets and Supersets
- Set A is subset of set B if all the elements in set A are included in set B 
- To determine whether set A is subset of set B 
  - Use the issubset method
  ```Format: setA.issubset(setB)```
  - Use the <= operator
  ```Format: setA <= setB```
- Set A is superset of set B if it contains all the elements of set B 
- To determine whether set A is superset of set B 
  - Use the issuperset method
  ```Format: setA.issuperset(setB)```
  - Use the >= operator
  ```Format: setA >= setB```
## Serializing Objects
- Serialize an object: convert the object to a stream of bytes that can easily be stored in a file  
- Pickling: serializing an object 
- To pickle an object: 
  - Import the pickle module 
  - Open a file for binary writing 
  - Call the pickle.dump function 
  ```Format: pickle.dump(object, file)``` 
  - Close the file 
- You can pickle multiple objects to one file prior to closing the file
- Unpickling: retrieving pickled object 
  - To unpickle an object: 
  - Import the pickle module 
  - Open a file for binary writing 
  - Call the pickle.load function 
  ```Format: pickle.load(file)``` 
  - Close the file 
- You can unpickle many objects from a file
# Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
## Procedural Programming
- Writing programs made of functions that perform specific tasks 
- Procedures typically operate on data items that are separate from the procedures 
- Data items commonly passed from one procedure to another 
- Focus: to create procedures that operate on the program’s data 
## Object-Oriented Programming
- Focused on creating objects
- Object: entity that contains data and procedures 
  - Data is known as data attributes and procedures are known as methods 
  - Methods perform operations on the data attributes
- Encapsulation: combining data and code into a single object 
- Data hiding: object’s data attributes are hidden from code outside the object 
  - Access restricted to only the object’s methods 
  - Protects from accidental corruption 
  - Outside code does not need to know internal structure of the object 
- Object reusability: the same object can be used in different programs  
  - Example: 3D image object can be used for architecture and game programming 
## An Everyday Example of an Object
- Data attributes: define the state of an object 
  - Example: clock object would have second, minute, and hour data attributes 
- Public methods: allow external code to manipulate the object 
  - Example: set_time, set_alarm_time 
- Private methods: used for object’s inner workings 
## Classes
- Class: code that specifies the data attributes and methods of a particular type of object 
  - Similar to a blueprint of a house or a cookie cutter 
- Instance: an object created from a class 
  - Similar to a specific house built according to the blueprint or a specific cookie 
  - There can be many instances of one class 
## Class Definitions
- Set of statements that define a class’s methods and data attributes 
```python
class Class_name:
```
- Method definition like any other python function definition
- self parameter: required in every method in the class – references the specific object that the method is working on
- Initializer method: automatically executed when an instance of the class is created
  - Initializes object’s data attributes and assigns self parameter to the object that was just created
  ```python
  def __init__ (self):
  ```
- To create a new instance of a class call the initializer method
```python3
My_instance = Class_Name()
```
- To call any of the class methods using the created instance, use dot notation
```python3
My_instance.method()
```
## Hiding Attributes and Storing Classes in Modules
- An object's data attributes should be private
  - To do this put two underscores (\__current_minute)
- Classes can be stored in modules
  - Filename for module must end in .py
  - Module can be imported to programs that use the class
## Accessor and Mutator Methods
- Typically, all of a class’s data attributes are private and provide methods to access and change them
- Accessor methods: return a value from a class’s attribute without changing it
  - Safe way for code outside the class to retrieve the value of attributes
- Mutator methods: store or change the value of a data attribute
## Passing Objects as Arguments
- Methods and functions often need to accept objects as arguments
- When you pass an object as an argument, you are actually passing a reference to the object
  - The receiving method or function has access to the actual object
# Inheritance
## Introduction to Inheritance
- In the real world, many objects are a specialized version of more general objects
  - Example: grasshoppers and bees are specialized types of insect, 
  - In addition to the general insect characteristics, they have unique characteristics:
    - Grasshoppers can jump
    - Bees can sting, make honey, and build hives
## Inheritance and the “Is a” Relationship
- “Is a” Relationship: exists when one object is a specialized version of another object
- Specialized object has all the characteristics of the general object plus unique characteristics
- Example: Rectangle **is a** shape
- Inheritance: used to create an “is a” relationship between classes 
- Superclass (base class): a general class 
- Subclass (derived class): a specialized class
  - An extended version of the superclass
  - Inherits attributes and methods of the superclass
  - New attributes and methods can be added
- For example, need to create classes for cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs
- All are automobiles
- Have a make, year model, mileage, and price 
  - This can be the attributes for the base class
- In addition:
  - Car has a number of doors 
  - Pickup truck has a drive type
  - SUV has a passenger capacity
- To indicate inheritance, the superclass name is placed in parentheses after subclass name
```python3
class Car(Automobile)
```
- The initializer method of a subclass calls the initializer method of the superclass and then initializes the unique data attributes
## Inheritance in UML Diagrams
- In UML diagram, show inheritance by drawing a line with an open arrowhead from subclass to superclass
## Polymorphism
- An object’s ability to take different forms
- Essential ingredients of polymorphic behavior:
  - Ability to define a method in a superclass and override it in a subclass
    - Subclass defines method with the same name
  - Ability to call the correct version of overridden method depending on the type of object that called for it
## isinstance function
- Polymorphism provides great flexibility when designing programs
- AttributeError exception: raised when a method is receives an object which is not an instance of the right class
- isinstance function: determines whether object is an instance of a class
```python3
isinstance(object, class)
```
# Recursion
## Introduction to Recursion

- Recursive function: a function that calls itself
- Recursive function must have a way to control the number of times it repeats
  - Usually involves an if-else statement which defines when the function should return a value and when it should call itself
- Depth of recursion: the number of times a function calls itself

## Problem Solving with Recursion

- Recursion is a powerful tool for solving repetitive problems
- Recursion is never required to solve a problem
  - Any problem that can be solved recursively can be solved with a loop
  - Recursive algorithms usually less efficient than iterative ones
    - Due to *overhead* of each function call
- Some repetitive problems are more easily solved with recursion
- General outline of recursive function:
  - If the problem can be solved now without recursion, solve and return
    - Known as the *base case*
  - Otherwise, reduce problem to smaller problem of the same structure and call the function again to solve the smaller problem
    - Known as the *recursive case*
    
## Using Recursion to Calculate the Factorial of a Number

- In mathematics, the *n!* notation represents the factorial of a number *n*
  - For *n* = 0, *n*! = 1
  - For *n* > 0, *n*! = 1 x 2 x 3 x … x *n*
- The above definition lends itself to recursive programming
  - *n* = 0 is the base case
  - *n* > 0 is the recursive case
    - factorial(*n*) = *n* x factorial(*n*-1)
- Since each call to the recursive function reduces the problem:
  - Eventually, it will get to the base case which does not require recursion, and the recursion will stop
- Usually the problem is reduced by making one or more parameters smaller at each function call

## Direct and Indirect Recursion

- Direct recursion: when a function directly calls itself
  - All the examples shown so far were of direct recursion
- Indirect recursion: when function A calls function B, which in turn calls function A

## The Fibonacci Series

- Fibonacci series: has two base cases
  - if n = 0 then Fib(n) = 0
  - if n = 1 then Fib(n) = 1
  - if n > 1 then Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
- Corresponding function code:
```python3
def fib(n):
   if n <= 1:
       return n
   else:
       return(fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))
```

## Finding the Greatest Common Divisor

- Calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers
  - If x can be evenly divided by y, then 
  - gcd(x,y) = y
  - Otherwise, gcd(x,y) = gcd(y, remainder of x/y)
- Corresponding function code:
```python3
def gcd(x , y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    else:
        return gcd(y, x % y)
```

## Recursion versus Looping

- Reasons not to use recursion:
  - Less efficient: entails function calling overhead that is not necessary with a loop
  - Usually a solution using a loop is more evident than a recursive solution
- Some problems are more easily solved with recursion than with a loop
  - Example: Fibonacci, where the mathematical definition lends itself to recursion
