## History of atom
### Democritus
- 440 BC
- Said matter was made up of tiny, individual particles that could not be divided, called atomos
- Plato and aristotle disagreed
### John dalton
- revives idea of atom
- In 1903 he claims
  - Matter is composed of small particles called atoms
  - Atoms are indivisible
  - Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass and chemical properties
  - Different atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds
  - In a chemical reaction, atoms are separated, combined, or rearranged
- Problems:
  - Atoms can be broken down in protons, neutrons and electrons
  - All atoms of the same element are not identical
### Eugen Goldstein
- Discovers anode rays which leads to discovery of proton
### JJ Thompson
- discovered electron through cathode ray
- came up with plum pudding model
- Thomson thought that electrons were mixed throughout an atom, like plums in a pudding
### Ernest Rutherford
- aimed a small beam of positively charged particles at a thin sheet of  gold foil in 1909
- They were suppposed to go through in a straight line
- Instead some were deflected
- Rutherford proposed that in the center of the atom is a nucleus
### Bohr model
- says electrons aren't located randomly
- electrons could be found in specific electron shells(orbitals or energy levels)
### James Chadwick
- Discovers a particle as big as proton but with neutral charge
- Its the neutron
- This helped to explain why atoms were heavier than the total mass of their protons and electrons
