## History of atom
### Democritus
- 440 BC
- Said matter was made up of tiny, individual particles that could not be divided, called atomos
- Plato and aristotle disagreed
### John dalton
- revives idea of atom
- In 1903 he claims
  - Matter is composed of small particles called atoms
  - Atoms are indivisible
  - Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass and chemical properties
  - Different atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds
  - In a chemical reaction, atoms are separated, combined, or rearranged
- Problems:
  - Atoms can be broken down in protons, neutrons and electrons
  - All atoms of the same element are not identical
### Eugen Goldstein
- Discovers anode rays which leads to discovery of proton
### JJ Thompson
- discovered electron through cathode ray
- came up with plum pudding model
- Thomson thought that electrons were mixed throughout an atom, like plums in a pudding

### Ernest Rutherford
- aimed a small beam of positively charged particles at a thin sheet of  gold foil in 1909
- They were suppposed to go through in a straight line
- Instead some were deflected
- Rutherford proposed that in the center of the atom is a nucleus

### Bohr model
- says electrons aren't located randomly
- electrons could be found in specific electron shells(orbitals or energy levels)
### James Chadwick
- Discovers a particle as big as proton but with neutral charge
- Its the neutron
- This helped to explain why atoms were heavier than the total mass of their protons and electrons

## Atomic Structure
### Location
- Nucleus
  - Proton = positive
  - Neutron = 0
- Outer
  - Electron = negative
### Atomic Number
- The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element
- The atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom.
### Mass number
- mass # = # protons + # neutrons
- Always whole number
- not on the periodic table

## Isotopes, ions, and average mass
### Isotopes
- atoms of the same element
- same protons, but different neutrons, so they have different masses but keep their identity

### Ions
- atoms or groups of atoms with a positive or negative charge
- charge
  - number of protons - number of electrons
- when an atom or molecule gains or loses an electron it becomes an ion
- Types of ions:
  - Cations
    - lost an electron
    - positive charge
    - Mg - 2e- ðŸ¡º Mg2+
  - Anions
    - gained an electron
    - negative charge
    - N + 3e-  ðŸ¡º N3-

### Average Atomic Mass
- weighted average of all isotopes
- appears on the Periodic Table under the Element symbol
- round to 2 decimal places
- equation
  - (mass of isotope 1 * abundance of isotope 1)+(mass of isotope n * abundance of isotope n)
- Ex: Find chlorineâ€™s average atomic mass if approximately 8 of every 10 atoms are chlorine-35 and 2 are chlorine-37.
- (35x0.8)+(37x0.2)=35.40amu

## [Periodic Table](https://ptable.com/)
### Earlier attempts at periodic table
- Lavoisier (1789) - 4 element groups
- J.W. Dobereiner (1829) - set of 3 elements with similar properties (Cl, Br, I) = triad
- John Newlands (1837 â€“ 1898) - Arranged elements by increasing atomic mass. 
  - Created law of octaves
- Lothar Meyer (1830 â€“ 1895) - Demonstrated a connection between atomic mass and elemental properties
### Mendeleev - 1869
- Organized elements by increasing [atomic mass](https://github.com/prakash-shekhar/notes/blob/main/science/unit2.md#average-atomic-mass)
- Elements with similar properties were grouped together in horizontal rows
- Predicted properties of undiscovered elements.
- Some discrepancies
### Mosely - 1913
- Organized elements by increasing [atomic mass](https://github.com/prakash-shekhar/notes/blob/main/science/unit2.md#average-atomic-mass)
- Similar elements in vertical columns
- Left spaces based in patterns for future discoveries
- Resolved discrepancies in Mendeleevâ€™s arrangement.
### Parts of periodic table
- Metals
  - Ductile (can be stretched)
  - Malleable (can be shaped & molded)
  - Conductive
  - Forms positive (+) ions
- Non-Metals
  - Brittle
  - Low melting point
  - Not malleable
  - Forms negative (â€“) ions 
- Metalloids
  - Conductive
  - Brittle
  - Low melting point
  - Forms (+) or (-) ions
### Periodic Law
- When arranged by increasing atomic number a pattern of properties repeats on a regular basis
- These patterns are related to the number of valence electrons for an element.
### Valence Electrons
- Valence
  - Electrons found on the outside energy level
  - Electrons gained or lost during chemical bonding
- Core Electrons
  - All of the electrons of the element in the lower energy levels
- Octet Rule
  - Every element, is unstable unless it has a full shell
  - They become more unstable as they approach the full shell or noble gas
### Group properties
- Group 1- Alkali Metals
  - 1 electron in the outer level
  - Very reactive metals
- Group 2- Alkaline Earth Metals
  - 2 electrons in the outer level
  - Very reactive metals, but not as much as Alkali Metals
  - Metals
- Group 3-12- Transition Metals
  - Usually 1-2 electrons in the outer level
  - Good conductors of electric current
  - Lanthanides and Actinides- Inner transition metals that appear in 2 rows at the bottom of the periodic table
- Group 13- Boron Group = 3 v. e.
- Group 14- Carbon Group = 4 v.e.
- Group 15- Nitrogen Group = 5 v.e.
- Group 16- Oxygen Group = 6 v.e.
- Group 17- Halogens
  - 7 electrons in the outer level
  - Very reactive nonmetals
  - Poor conductors of electric current
- Group 18- Noble Gases
  - 8 electrons in the outer level (except Helium, which has 2)
  - Unreactive nonmetals

## Periodic Trends
### Atomic size(radius)
- Atoms get larger as you go down a group
  - More energy levels results in larger size
- Atoms get bigger as you go across a period from right to left
  - More electrons in the same energy level results in a greater pull toward the center
### Electronegativity
- increases as you go to the right in a period
  - Nonmetals want to fill their outer level
- increases as you go up a group
  - Electrons are closer  to their nucleus, more control
### Ionization Energy
- energy required to remove an electron
- Increases to the right in a period
- Increases up a group
  - In smaller atoms, electrons are closer to nucleus so it takes more energy to remove
### Ion size
- relative size of an ion
- cations usually lose levels (e-s) and become smaller than neutral atom
- anions fill levels (gain   e-s) and become larger than neutral atom
- Ion Size increases down a group
